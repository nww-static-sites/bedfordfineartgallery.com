  "body": "Charles Augustus Lasar, known as \"Shorty\" Lasar was a Johnstown, Pennsylvania-born artist. As did many American artists, he travelled to Paris to broaden his art education. He studied under painter-sculptor Jean-Leon Gerome, who also taught Pennsylvania-born artists Mary Cassatt and Thomas Eakins. Lasar's draftsmanship became legendary during his tenure at Jean-Leon Gerome's atelier. After several years of successful exhibitions, Lasar opened his own atelier, which catered to English-speaking female artists.",
