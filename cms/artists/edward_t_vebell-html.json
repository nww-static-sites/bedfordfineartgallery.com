   "body" : "Edward Vebell grew up in Chicago during the depression and spent hours copying cartoons from the Chicago Tribune. While attending a private Catholic school, the nuns spotted his artistic talent and began relying on him to draw biblical scenes on the blackboard. Vebell began his career as a catalog illustrator for Montgomery Ward and Sears & Roebuck; however, his art career was put on hold when he was drafted into the Army. His artistic skills saved him from combatâ€”he was sent to Casa Blanca as a staff artist. Vebell spent his time on the front lines capturing battle scenes all over Europe. His last assignment for Stars & Stripes was covering the Nuremberg war trials.",
