  "body": "Albert Francis King was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was recognized as Pittsburgh's primary still-life painter during the 19th century. King was largely self-taught, but studied under Martin B. Leisser, a noted Scalp-Level landscape artist. Although he is best known for his still-lifes, he was much sought after as a portrait painter and painted many of the prominent citizens of Pittsburgh, including composer Stephen Foster. Many of his portraits hung in the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh.",
