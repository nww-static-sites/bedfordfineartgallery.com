He was well-traveled, visiting France, Spain, England, Tangiers and Morocco, the latter where some of his works were executed. He also traveled to the American west where he painted, notably Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was a member of the Society of Washington Artists (DC), where he exhibited, in addition to the National Academy of Design.",
