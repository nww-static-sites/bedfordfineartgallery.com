In addition to his painting and teaching, Michael is a skilled art conservationist for both private collectors and public museums (The Western Center for Art Conservation, Denver, CO; Art Conservation Laboratory, Raymond, NH; and Westmoreland Museum of American Art, Greensburg, PA). Michael received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting and Printmaking (Boston University, Boston, MA), and a Master of Fine Arts in Painting Conservation â€“ Dominican University, River Forest. IL and Villa Schifanoia Graduate School of Fine Arts (Florence, Italy). His thesis was The Practice of Picture Cleaning in Oil and Tempera Mediums. He has authored two books, Why Do?... A Book of Answers, and an autobiography, Fifty Years a Conservator of Paintings. Michael's paintings almost always contain an anomaly or a little mystery. This painting represents an old church cemetery along the Forbes Road near Laughlintown, in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, which has been witness to a prodigal woman in white.",
