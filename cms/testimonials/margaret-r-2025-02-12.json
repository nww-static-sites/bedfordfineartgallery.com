  "longTestimonial": "I contacted the Bedford Fine Art Gallery to inquire about selling an older painting. I did not know what to expect but was treated to a friendly and honest conversation with the owner, Jerry. Due to his artistic knowledge, he was able to assess the authenticity of my painting based on digital pictures and share the approximate auction value. He made a good offer to buy the painting (paid upfront) and I shipped it to the gallery. I do not live anywhere near Pennsylvania so there was a level of trust since I could not handle this transaction in person, but I am very happy with the outcome. The entire transaction was very smooth and I had excellent communication the entire time. I highly recommend the Bedford Gallery to those in a similar position - you will not be disappointed.",
