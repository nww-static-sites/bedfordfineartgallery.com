  "longTestimonial": "Gerry was amazing to work with. Called him totally out of the blue, to sell a painting from my mom’s estate. Promptness is an understatement. He had me a (very fair well researched) quote the very next day. I accepted, and the entire process seriously could not have been smoother. Thank you Bedford Fine Art Gallery!!",
