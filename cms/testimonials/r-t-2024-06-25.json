  "longTestimonial": "What a pleasant and surprisingly exciting experience, purchasing my painting from the Bedford Fine Art Gallery became. The purchase was made online and Jerry described every detail and nuance of the condition. The painting arrived exactly as described. Jerry has guided me through lighting and positioning decisions after the fact, and I truly appreciate his expertise. On a fun note, the artist C.R. Murdock, is my third great aunt and I am so pleased to reunite this painting with the current matriarch of our Murdock family, my mother Barbara.",
