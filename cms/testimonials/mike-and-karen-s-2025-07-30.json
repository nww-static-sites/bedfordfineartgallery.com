  "longTestimonial": "My wife and I recently discovered a 19th century landscape artist, Emil Bott, who lived and died in our county.  We were excited to learn that Bedford Fine Art Gallery had one of his paintings in their gallery.  This was our first time buying a painting.  While this was very exciting it could have been intimidating. Jerry and Joan made it a smooth and wonderful experience by putting us at ease with their knowledge and gracious manner.",
