  "longTestimonial": "When I'm searching for an artist, or a tone and style that I love, I turn to Bedford Fine Art Gallery. Gerald Hawk and staff are courteous, friendly, and, best of all, they know their art. The kind of hands-on service they offer is rare, from conserved and framed artwork to shipping, far above and beyond other galleries. I've purchased three paintings that I love from Gerald. If you're looking for late 19th or early 20th Century art, and even some modern surprises, you can't go wrong with Bedford Fine Art Gallery.",
