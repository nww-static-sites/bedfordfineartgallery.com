  "longTestimonial": "When I first saw the painting, it reminded me of a time gone by, when life was so much more simple, where everyone was less in a rush, a time when everyone knew everyone, a time where people actually cared for their fellow man.  The painting now has a place in my home where I will see it everyday, a place where I can look and escape, even if just a few moments.  Again, thank you very much!  You have spread some sunshine into my life!",
