  "longTestimonial": "The painting arrived, a little late because of the storm, and in perfect condition. \nThank you so so much. It is absolutely beautiful, and the original information you enclosed is fascinating!  To think that it has been here, since the mid 1960s, passed around I presume to various folks and family, and that he was such an accomplished painter.   It is a joy to have in our collection, and we will take good care of it, for the rest of our lives.  Thank you.",
