  "longTestimonial": "I would like to give a personal recommendation from my first-hand experience with the Bedford Fine Art Gallery during February and March of 2024. I had an original antique painting that needed a new home. I called Jerry Hawk of the Bedford Fine Art Gallery to discuss the painting and he was extremely professional from the  first phone call to the final transaction. I highly recommend Mr. Hawk and the Bedford Fine Art Gallery. They are honest, trustworthy, knowledgeable and it was a pleasant experience! Thank you.",
