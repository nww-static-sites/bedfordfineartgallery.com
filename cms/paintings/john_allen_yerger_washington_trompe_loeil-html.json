  "body": "Yerger was born in Buffalo, New York and studied art at Nardin Academy and the Art Institute of Buffalo. Following service during the Korean War, he took further study at the Vesper George School of Art in Boston, Massachusetts. His first exhibition was in 1965 at the University of Buffalo and a solo show in 1966 at D'Youville College. Early in his career, Yerger, concentrated painting landscapes and miniature objet d’art. It wasn’t until the 1990s that began painting his masterful trompe l’oeils ( “tricks of the eye” ). \n\nArt Historian William Gerdts said of Yerger: \"Yerger has mastered not only the formulae of Trompe l'oeil but also through his profound study and love of the history of American art, has paid homage to that history by incorporating it into his still-life paintings...” Yerger was a member of The Miniature Art Society of Western New York and exhibited at the Marin-Price Galleries (1994, Chevy Chase, MD.}; Schaff Gallery (1999, 2000, Cincinnati, OH); Meibohm Fine Arts, Inc,(2004,  East Aurora, NY); Pan American Art Gallery (2005, Dallas, TX) and the Adelson Galleries (2007, New York, NY).",
