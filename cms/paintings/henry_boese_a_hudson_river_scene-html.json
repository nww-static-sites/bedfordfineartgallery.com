  "body": "Mystery often times surrounds an artist’s life, even if he is one of the first generation Hudson River School landscapist painters.  Such is the case of Henry Boese.  Most available sources list his birth date as 1824 in New York, but here is where the mystery begins.  Most of these same sources list the year of his death as 1863, but do not list the city where he died.  This is unusual since he was known to have to have exhibited at the National Academy of design in New York City in 1847, 1857, 1859, and in 1863. One does not simply become a member of the Academy; one is elected by their peers on the basis of recognized excellence; therefore he was not an obscure artist painting in a vacuum.\n\nOnly the Smithsonian lists his death as occurring in New York City; however the year given is 1897.  Why the discrepancy?  There is a Henry Bose, spelled B-O-S-E, not B-O-E-S-E, who served with the 17th Regiment Veteran Infantry organized at Staten Island, N.Y., June 13 to October 17, 1863.  Is it the same Boese, just sloppy spelling?  If it is our Boese, could this be the reason he stopped exhibiting in 1863?  One of his chronologies alludes to him as painting after the Civil War, but still has his death as 1863.  A picture of Boese included with this same source shows a balding, elderly man with white hair and beard.\n\nFinally, the January 2, 1897 edition of the New York Times lists a Henry Boese as dying on New Year’s Day.  His address was the former Park Centre Hotel located at the corner of 5th Avenue and East 115th Street, but nothing about being an artist.  This suggests that he died in 1897; unfortunately, we can only speculate on his life and academic training whose wonderful landscapes of the Hudson River valley and adjacent highlands clearly show the influence of the Hudson River School artists.\n\nH﻿igh auction record for this artist: $26,290.",
