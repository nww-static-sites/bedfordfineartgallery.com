  "body": "We believe that Sorver was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but we are not entirely sure. We also believe that Sorver had two sons, J.D. Sorver Jr., and Robert D. Sorver. In 1863 Sorver enlisted for service during the Civil War under Col. Alfred Day. He served as Captain in one of Day’s regiments for a period of three months, before being mustered out. After that, his trail is faint; however, following the war, in 1865, a Joseph D. Sorver purchased property in Haddonfield, New Jersey. In 1872 the Sorvers sold the property and built a house on West End Avenue in Haddonfield.\n\nIt is possible that Sorver kept a studio in Philadelphia, as when he exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1888, he gave a Philadelphia address. In 1877, Sorver contributed one of his paintings, “Trenton Falls,” for the benefit of Philadelphia landscape artist, George W. Holmes, who had lost his eyesight and was no long able to follow his profession. He was probably a student of Holmes, as this exhibition and sale of paintings was sponsored about his former students. \n\nSorver's oeuvre was charming, intimate portrayals of chickens – in barnyards, posed by baskets, and against a landscape. It was one of his “chicken paintings” that he exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1888.",
