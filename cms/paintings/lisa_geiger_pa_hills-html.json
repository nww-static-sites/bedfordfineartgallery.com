  "body": "Lisa Geiger is a Wisconsin artist who exhibited artistic talent as a youth and always enjoyed working in creative mediums whether graphite, colored pencils, oil painting, pastels, watercolors, or the culinary arts. Lisa has always perceived and appreciated the beauty in things whether it’s her surroundings or food.  Light, shadow, color, texture, and composition are careful considerations in her artwork.\n\nNow that her youngest child has gone off to college, she spends more time honing her craft, particularly oils, watercolors and pastels. She works tirelessly and reads voraciously. She also attends classes taught by nationally renowned artists Joyce Hicks, Doug Dawson, Lois Griffel, Lee Mothes and David Cheifetz, among others, to challenge her abilities and to continue to improve her skills. \n\nLisa’s works have been accepted for exhibition at Wisconsin art venues. Lisa has painted scenes of Pennsylvania on her visits here and provides this description for this painting, \"Driving through Pennsylvania Between Bedford and Pittsburgh in early fall is a real treat. The greases and trees are a myriad of greens that set off the yellows, reds, and pinks of the wildflowers.\"",
