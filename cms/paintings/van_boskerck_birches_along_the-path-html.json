  "body": "Although little biographical information is currently available for landscape painter, Robert Ward Van Boskerck, we know that he was born in Hoboken, New Jersey and graduated from the Columbia University School of Mines in 1877. Engineering was not to be his calling, though. He took art instruction from Luminist painter R. Swain Gifford at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City and Tonalist landscape painter Alexander Helwig Wyant. He painted scenes along the Ottauquechee River near Woodstock, Vermont, the Keene Valley in the Adirondack Mountains, the Great Salt Pond in Wakefield, Rhode Island, Peace Dale, Rhode Island, Hackensack Valley, New Jersey, and Greenport, Long Island.\n\nHe visited Europe and painted scenes of Belgium canals, Normandy, France, Venetian canals, and Haddon Meadows and Bakewell Church in Derbyshire, England. Van Boskerck traveled in the circle of venerable New York artists of the time as documented by a photograph published in Archives of American Art Journal dated May 26, 1888 titled “Artists at a banquet for Harry Siddons Mowbray.” The photograph is of a group of Mowbray's friends in evening dress seated and standing around a long table, many who appear to be singing. On the back the artists in attendance are listed including Mowbray, William Merritt Chase, William Anderson Coffin, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, J. Alden Weir, and Stanford White, among others.\n\nVan Boskerck was a member of the National Academy of Design (Associate 1897, Academician 1907); Society of American Artists (1887). He exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association (1879-1885, 1892); National Academy of Design (1880-1900); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1880, 1900); Boston Art Club (1881-1885); Art Institute of Chicago (1888-1891, 1912-1913); American Watercolor Society (1898); Carnegie International (1898); Pan-American Exposition (Buffalo. 1901); St. Louis Exposition (1904, medal); Corcoran Gallery (1907-1908, 1930) and Society of Independent Artists (1919).\n\nH﻿igh auction record for this artist: $9,600.",
