  "body": "De Nagy was born in Budapest, Hungary and studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest and in Munich, Paris and Florence.  He had painted throughout Europe before he and family immigrated to New York City in 1931.  While in Europe, he had painted the portraits of the Emperor Francis Josef and the family of the Grand Duchess of Luxemburg while in still in Europe.  A versatile artist, De Nagy included portrait, landscape, still-life, marine and genre painting among his oeuvre.  He began exhibiting in the mid-1930s at the Salons of America (Rockefeller Center, NYC) and the Society of Independent Artists (Grand Central Palace, NYC).  He is perhaps best known for his portrait, “The Forgotten Man.” The model was a down-and-out musician he had seen, hunched in despair on a New York City park bench during a cold February night. He invited the man to hot coffee and sandwiches and then to his studio to sit for the painting.  The work took multiple sittings to complete; however, the unfortunate musician died not long after the painting was completed.  In 1936 A portrait of Colonel Frederick Allen, president of the National League of American of Foreign Descent, Inc., of which De Nagy was a member, was presented a portrait of himself, painted by De Nagy. De Nagy also painted portraits of professional golfer Gene Sarazen, violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler. ",
