  "body": "Lavine, a western Maryland native, has been living in Greensboro, North Carolina since 2002. An award-winning watercolorist, her paintings have been in many juried shows and gallery exhibitions. The talented artist’ s paintings are in the collections of both the private and corporate sectors. A consummate artist, Lavine states that “without superior design, a well-crafted and technically well painted watercolor will still fall flat. Design, the art of arranging all the pieces of a painting on the surface of the paper, is paramount. Making a painting that is eye-catching, engages the viewer, expresses a mood or an emotion, tells a story…that requires some thoughtful, strategic designing.”\n\nShe is intrigued by what she sees in her surroundings – she is endlessly challenged to express what she sees and how she feels, in her own way, through her art. Lavine is a member of the American Watercolor Society; National Watercolor Society; Transparent Watercolor Society of America; Watercolor USA Honor Society; Watercolor West; North East Watercolor Society; Southern Watercolor Society, Baltimore Watercolor Society; and the Watercolor Society of North Carolina.",
