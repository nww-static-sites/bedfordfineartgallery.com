  "body": "Sperry was born in Hartford, Connecticut. His parents encouraged his early interest in art, and he took study with Alfred Hart in Hartford. When he was 24, he moved to New York City to study at the National Academy of Design. Sperry returned to Hartford, where he taught at the art academy.  Prior to this, Sperry practiced as a commercial artist and designer and created illustrations and engravings for numerous publications of the time. In 1874 he was commissioned to illustrate writer and humorist Mark Twainâ€™s Sketches, and that same year, Sperry moved to New York City and Mark Twain moved to Hartford.\n\nIn 1880 Sperry was hired by Richard M. Johnson, manager of the New York office of the Travelers Insurance Company to create a model of the home office of Travelers Insurance back in Hartford. Circa 1900, Sperry left New York and spent some time in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Indianapolis, Indiana working as an engraver. He returned to Hartford where he died in 1914, Although a competent artist in oils, he is best known for his engravings and illustrations.",
