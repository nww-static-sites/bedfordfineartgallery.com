  "body": "G. F. Keil was an American artist of the 19th century. Titled “A Sportsman’s Paradise,” it is painted in the romantic style of the Hudson River School—a forest interior with sunlight shining through a break in the trees to highlight some deer foraging along a rocky mountain creek edge and the pale grayish blue of distant mountains. It evokes the serenity of a hidden retreat to which the viewer can escape.",
