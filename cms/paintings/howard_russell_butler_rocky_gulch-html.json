  "body": "Butler was born in New York City, the son of lawyer and satirist William Allen Butler. His early training included was with William Shannon and time spent at the National Academy of Design and in the studio of his uncle William Stanley Haseltine, who was in New York City from 1858-1866.\n\nIn 1876 Butler obtained a science degree from Princeton University in New Jersey and was an assistant professor of physics there until circa 1878, when he was in New York City making technical illustrations. In 1881 Butler graduated from Columbia University with a law degree and practiced patent law until 1884 when decided to pursue painting as a career full-time.\n\nIn January of that year, he traveled to Mexico to study with Hudson River painter Frederic Church who was there for reasons of health. This was followed by study at the Art Students League with J. Carroll Beckwith and George de Forest Brush. From 1885 to 1887 Butler was in France and painted at the American artists’ colony at Concarneau in Brittany.\n\nIn 1889 while raising funds to build the Fine Arts building at 215 West 57th Avenue, Butler met industrialist Andrew Carnegie. After this meeting Carnegie employed Butler for the next 10 years, allowing him time each day to paint. During a 1902 conversation between Butler and Andrew Carnegie, as the latter was sitting for his portrait, Butler persuaded Carnegie to fund construction of Lake “Carnegie” on the Princeton campus, as there was no adequate place for the rowing team.\n\nIn 1918, Butler was invited on an expedition to Baker City, Oregon organized by the U.S. Naval Observatory to observe and the solar eclipse that was observed from Baker City in Oregon. He made paintings of the solar eclipses of 1918, 1923 and 1925, which were hung in The Pro-Astronomic Hall (predecessor of the Hayden Planetarium) of the American Museum of Natural History. Although he made paintings of eclipses and the planets, Butler is best known for his coastal scenes.\n\nIn 1926, Butler painted seven large paintings of Zion National Park and one of Grand Canyon National Park under commission of the Union Pacific Railroad for their “Grand Circle Tour”. He moved to Princeton1n 1913 after having lived in New York and California. He died there in 1934. \n\nButler was a member of the Society of American Artists (1889); National Academy of Design (associate, 1897, academician, 1899); New York Watercolor Society; Architectural League of America, 1889); Century Association; Lotos Club; National Arts Club; National Institute of Arts and Letters; Art Students League; American Federation of Arts; and American Fine Arts Society; (founder).\n\nHe exhibited at the Paris Salon (1886, prize; 1887; National Academy of Design (1885-1935, prize 1916); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1888, medal; 1892, 1894-1898, 1909, 1917-1918, 1921); Paris Expo.
