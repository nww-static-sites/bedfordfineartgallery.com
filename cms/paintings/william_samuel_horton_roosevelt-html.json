  "body": "This painting of Teddy Roosevelt was painted by American Impressionist painter William Samuel Horton.  We estimate this painting was completed circa 1909 in Red Wing Minnesota.  At this time, Roosevelt was in Red Wing to sign the Presidential Proclamation #848 establishing the Superior National Forest.\n\nHorton was born in Michigan and lived in New York and France.  He was a member of the New York Watercolor Club, Salmagund Club, American Federation of Arts, Society International, Salon d’Automone and other art clubs.  Horton was a wealthy man and was reportedly friends with such famous Impressionists as Monet, Degas, Derain and others.\n\nAfter his early Paris exhibitions, he rarely allowed his works to be sold.  At his death in 1936, his estate contained more than 1,000 oils, pastels, and watercolors.  His works are part of the Brooklyn Museum and the Collection National Museum of American Art in Washington DC.  The art critic Henri Fritsch Estrangin stated “Horton’s work is a feast of color and light.”\n\nHorton was a member of the New York Water Color Club; Salmagundi Club; American Federation of Arts; and Société Moderne Internationale Salon d’Automne.\n\nHe exhibited at the National Academy of Design (1888-1896); Boston Art Club (1890); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1890-1912, 9 times); Paris Salon (1895, 1897-1899); Gal. George Petit and Gal. Berheim Jeune (Paris, 1898-WWI, many solos); Art Institute of Chicago (1897-1909); International Exposition (Nantes, 1904, gold); Orlean (1905, medal).\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $104,500.",
