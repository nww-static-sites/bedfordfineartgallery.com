  "body": "Black was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  She enrolled in the School of Painting at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where she studied with Otto Grundmann and Frank Crowninshield.  In the early 1890s, she left for New York City to study at the Art Students League under William Merritt Chase and Edwin Blashfield.  Under the tutelage of William Merritt Chase, Black studied plein air techniques of the Impressionists, and was considered one of Chase’s best students.  She also attended Shinnecock Summer School of Art on Long Island, where Chase taught.\n\nBlack moved to New York City in 1910; however, she maintained a summer residence in South Egremont, Massachusetts, where Barbizon-style artist Hugh Bolton Jones also summered.  Jones apparently had a great influence on Black’s style also—skillfully executed landscapes that combined looser brushwork of the Impressionists with Barbizon-derived tonal qualities. \n\nShe was a member of the National Association of Women Artists; Painters, Sculptors; New York Society of painters; American Artists Professional League and the Boston Art Students Association (Copley Society in Boston). Black exhibited at the National Academy of Design (1897 to 1930); Boston Art Club; the Art Club of Philadelphia; the Carnegie Institute; American Artists Professional League; Boston Art Club/Copley Society of Boston; National Association of Women Artists, Painters, Sculptors; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; and Vose Galleries (Boston).\n\nH﻿igh auction record for this artist:$16,800.",
