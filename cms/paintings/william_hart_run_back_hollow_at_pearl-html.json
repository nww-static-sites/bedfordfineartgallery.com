  "body": "Hart was born in Paisley, Scotland, but circa 1830 he immigrated with his family to Albany, New York.  After he had served an apprenticeship painting decorative panels for an Albany coach maker, Hart moved onto painting portraits, opening his first studio in his father’s woodshed.  Over his career he would maintain studios in Albany, New York City, Brooklyn, and finally Mount Vernon, NY.  In 1842 Hart was in Michigan seeking portraiture commissions; however, he returned to Albany in 1845 in poor health.  Notwithstanding, he concentrated on his art, which by this time, was landscape painting.  His efforts paid off, for in 1849 an Albany patron financed his travel to Scotland to study. \n\nHart returned to Albany in 1852 with health much improved and in 1853 moved to New York City, where he concentrated on landscape painting in the manner of the Hudson River School.  He is known for his tranquil landscapes that often included cows.  Post-Civil War New York City was teeming with Nouveau Riche who fancied themselves as being among the “cultured elite”.  They found Hart’s paintings of rural landscapes appealing and, as bibliophile and author, Sinclair Hamilton observed, Hart “painted in a language intelligible for the artistically illiterate”.  Later, he and his brother William opened studios in Keene Valley, New York, “Home of the High Peaks”—the Adirondacks Mountains.  Throughout the late 1850s and 1870s, Hart made trips to the White Mountains in New Hampshire. \n\nHart was the founder of the American Water Color Society in 1865 and was the first president of the Brooklyn Academy of Design where he was also an instructor.  Hart Exhibited at National Academy of Design, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Art, Brooklyn Art Association, and the Boston Athenaeum.\n\nHigh auction record for this artist $﻿134,500.",
