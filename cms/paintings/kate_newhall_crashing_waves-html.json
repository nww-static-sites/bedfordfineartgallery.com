  "body": "Kate Newhall was born in Fall River, Massachusetts and spent her early years in Concord, New Hampshire. Interested in making her way as an artist, Newhall studied at the Cooper Union in New York City from 1863 to 1864. In the early 1870s, Newhall was living in Brooklyn, NY and took lessons from Carleton Wiggins, Rufus Wright and noted Long Island marine painter Mauritz F.H. de Haas.\n\nNewhall lived in Plainfield, New Jersey from 1875 to 1897, before moving to Redlands, California with her brother, Rev. Charles S. Newhall. Shortly thereafter, she moved to Berkeley and opened a studio. Newhall studied with William Keith and would go on sketching trips with him. She also became friends with another of Keith’s students—Leola Hall Coggins. Newhall painted Monterey, Santa Barbara and at Lake Tahoe. It was in California that she focused on marine paintings, specifically, coastal scenes of waves breaking on the beach. Newhall exhibited at the Golden Gate Park Museum.",
