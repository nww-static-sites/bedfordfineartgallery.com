  "body": "Do not confuse “George T.” with his famous uncle, Pittsburgh landscapist and founder of the Scalp Level School, George Hetzel.  Hetzel grew up in the Spring Hill section of Pittsburgh; however, little is known of his art education or exhibition history.  That he had artistic talent is not disputed; however, it is likely that he was only a part-time artist, as it is known that he served as the Deputy Recorder of Allegheny County.  One of his paintings is included in the collection of the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, Greensburg, Pennsylvania.",
