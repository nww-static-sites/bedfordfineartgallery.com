  "body": "Millbrook, New York artist Peter Corbin is known for sporting art landscapes, a subject that reflects his interest in the outdoors and his interest in hunting and fishing. Corbin studied painting and sculpture at the Pomfret School, Wesleyan University where he received a B.A. with High Honors in Art, and studied at the California College of Arts and Crafts.  Corbin says of his work, \"My paintings are done on four or five levels. They tell a story, and I'm always trying to work the light to the dark and the dark to the light, trying to draw the viewer into the painting. I try for asymmetrical balance, so there isn't something sitting in the center of the canvas.  When I do a hunting or fishing painting, my goal is always to capture the essence of the experience. It may not be exactly as it happened, but it is faithful to the way it is remembered.\"  His greatest influences have been A.B. Frost, Ogden Pleissner and Winslow Homer.  He has exhibited widely including: The Philadelphia Wildfowl Exposition (1980); Wildlife in Art, National Wildlife Federation (1983, Vienna, Virginia); Leigh Yawkley Woodson Art Museum (Wausau WI 1986, 1987, 1992, 2005, 2010); American Museum of Flyfishing (1991, Manchester, VT); American Academy of Equine Art (1991, Leesburg, Virginia); The Society of Animal Artists (1991, 1992, 1993), among many more.  His work also appears in many books and periodicals. \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $36,400.",
