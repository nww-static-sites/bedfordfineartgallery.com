  "body": "Born in Staindrop, County Durham, England, Miller’s first art training was from his father, British artist, Joseph Miller.  In the early 1840s, Miller along with a sister and two brothers immigrated to the United States and lived in Buffalo, NY before permanently moving to New York City.  A buyer of one his early watercolors, recognizing talent, financed a trip to London, England so he could further his art training.\n\nAlthough he made his living by portraiture and illustration, he was drawn to the scenery of upstate New York and made it the subject of his landscapes.  He had first started exhibiting at the New York Academy of Design in 1844 and by 1853 his career was firmly established.  He was in demand for his illustration work, providing illustration for a number of New York weeklies, in addition to illustrating \"Homes of American Authors” (Briggs and Putnam, 1853).\n\nMiller was a highly disciplined artist, but lived a relatively secluded life, producing expertly executed art works in watercolor, oil, and pen and ink.  He resided in Central Park and Long Island areas of New York City, but made sketching trips to the Hudson River Valley, Niagara Falls in New York State and to Virginia for inspiration.  Miller was a member of the Brooklyn Art Association, where he exhibited.  He also exhibited at the National Academy of Design and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.",
