  "body": "Albert Francis King was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was recognized as Pittsburgh’s primary still-life painter during the 19th century.  King was largely self-taught, but studied under Martin B. Leisser, a noted Scalp-Level landscape artist.  Although he is best known for his still-lifes, he was much sought after as a portrait painter and painted many of the prominent citizens of Pittsburgh, including composer Stephen Foster.  Many of his portraits hung in the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh.  His still-life compositions included, fruit (especially watermelons), vegetables and fish depicting meal preparation, similar to those by Jean-Bapiste-Simeon Chardin, a great 18th century French still-life painter.  King also painted landscapes and painted at Scalp Level with Leisser and Scalp Level School of painting founder, George Hetzel.  King was a member of the Pittsburgh Art Society and the Pittsburgh Art Association. \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $43,750.",
