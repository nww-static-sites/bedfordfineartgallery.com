  "body": "Hudson River artist Max Eglau was born in Bavaria, and immigrated to New York city circa 1850, living in the Lower East Side and exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1860. A skilled artist and respected teacher, he was Professor of Decorative Designing at the Cooper Institute from circa 1870 to his death in 1896. During this same period Eglau also taught at the Institution for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes (now the New York School for the Deaf) and a number of city grammar schools. At the age of seventy, Eglau was murdered in his classroom in the Art Building of the Institution.  Although there were several suspects, the murder of the respected artist was never solved, and more tragically, the emphasis on Eglau’s life has been his murder and not on his art.",
