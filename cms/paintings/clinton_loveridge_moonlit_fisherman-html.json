We know nothing of his early training; however, in the late 1840s Albany had entered an artistic “golden age.” Did Loveridge study with the two well-known Albany landscape painters, the brothers, William M. Hart and William McDougal Hart? We don’t know. We do know that by 1859 he had opened a studio in Albany and remained there until he enlisted to fight in the Civil War in 1861.\n\nHe was wounded at the Battle of Hanover Court in 1862 and an injury to his left leg injury resulted in amputation, for which he was to receive an artificial leg. After the war, Loveridge moved to Brooklyn, New York and moved into a “cottage” on Twelfth Street where he occupied the first floor and genre painter Samuel Carr occupied the second floor, where he would remain for many years.\n\nLoveridge is best-known for his quiet, rural landscapes, usually with cows, featuring prominently. A great lover of nature, his hand and brush were at a disadvantage in keeping up with his thoughts as he applied paint to canvas to capture a recent scene that caught his attention. In the late 1890s, Loveridge began producing more works in watercolor than oil.\n\nHe exhibited at the National Academy of Design (1867-99) and the Brooklyn Art Club (1867-82, 1884).\n\nHigh auction record for this artist: $19,500.",
