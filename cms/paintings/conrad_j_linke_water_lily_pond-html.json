  "body": "There is very little biographical information available for illustrator and painter Conrad Linke. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1892 and appears to have remained there for his entire life. Linke was successful at his craft and produced illustrations for magazines of the time, including The Saturday Evening Post. In 1959 he purchased the well-known retail space known then as The Pinehurst on the corner of 13th and Pine, that still houses Dirty Frankâ€™s, a popular Philadelphia drinking establishment, opened in the 1930s. Linke was one of the many prominent artists who moved to The Pinehurst in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Linke renamed The Pinehurst, Pine Crest Apartments and retained ownership of it until 1970. He died in Philadelphia in 1995.",
