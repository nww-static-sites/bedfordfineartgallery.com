  "body": "Drew was born in New York City and where, with the exception of some travels he made in the pursuit of subjects for his paintings, he remained there until his death. Very little biographical information is available for Drew; however, it is known that he was a student of New England landscape painter Henry Pember Smith, and the two traveled and painted together throughout New England, especially Connecticut, and Italy. It is reported that Drew also studied with, Italian-born, California artist John Califano, who immigrated to the United States in 1881 and exhibited at the National Academy of Design (NYC), which may be where the two crossed paths. Known mostly for his landscapes, executed in a style reminiscent of Smith, he also painted still-lifes with the same exacting detail as that of his landscapes. Although Drew did not fully embrace the Impressionist style, he at least experimented a bit, because you can find that some of his landscapes were painted in the manner of the Impressionists. Drew also painted a mural for the Travers Island Yacht House in Mount Vernon, New York. Drew was a member of the National Academy of Design; Salons of America and Society of Independent Artists. He exhibited at the Allied Artists of America; National Academy of Design; Salons of America; Society of Independent Artists, New York State Fair; Newark State Fair, Newark Museum; and New York Museum of Science & Industry.",
