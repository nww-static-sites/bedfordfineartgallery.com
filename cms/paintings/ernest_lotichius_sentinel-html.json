  "body": "Landscape painter, Ernest Lotichius was born in Wiesbaden, Germany and later worked in Dusseldorf and Munich where he lived until circa 1841, to study and paint. He later immigrated to the United States and was living in New York City ca. 1854. Lotichius is considered to be one of the Hudson River School artists; his painting “Falls of the Kaaterskill” (1857), after a version painted years earlier by Hudson River School founder, Thomas Cole, suggests that he knew of these artists or was at least familiar with their work. “The Silent Sentinel” was painted in the Hudson River School style, and illustrates his skill with brush and color in capturing the wonder and sublimity of nature, characteristic of these artists. Lotichius remained in the United States for 20 years, leaving circa 1874 to return to Wiesbaden, and spent time in Kronberg as well. Lotichius had exhibited at the National Academy of Design (NYC), Brooklyn Art Association, Cosmopolitan Art Association, the Philadelphia Sketch Club, and the Zanesville Industrial Exposition. It has been reported that a number of his paintings are in museums throughout the United States; however, very few of his paintings have come to market over the last few decades. In fact, it is likely that a number of his paintings, which were in possession of family members in Germany, were lost in the bombings in Dresden and Frankfort during World War II.",
