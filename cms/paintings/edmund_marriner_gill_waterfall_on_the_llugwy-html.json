  "body": "Gill was born in Born in Clerkenwell, London, England, the son of portrait and animal painter Edmund Ward Gill. His younger brothers, William Ward Gill and George Reynolds Gill were also artists. Gill moved with his father from London to Ludlow in Shropshire and was so inspired by the picturesque surroundings of the town that he sought a vocation as a landscape painter. In 1841 he met landscape painter David Cox in Birmingham, whose influence likely further strengthened Gill’s desire to pursue landscape painting.\n\nIn 1843, he went to London for study at the Royal Academy. His love of the English, Scottish and Welsh landscapes drew him into their rugged landscapes to paint. Som many of his landscapes feature a rugged mountain stream cascading over a waterfall – hence, his nickname “Waterfall” Gill. He traveled extensively throughout England, Scotland and Wales to capture these wild scenes in oil and watercolor. He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1842 to 1886. In 1873 and 1876 Gill exhibited his waterfall landscapes at the Crystal Palace Picture Competition (Sydenham, S.E., London) and received silver medals in 1873 and a bronze medal in 1876.\n\nH﻿igh auction price for this artist: %13,970.",
