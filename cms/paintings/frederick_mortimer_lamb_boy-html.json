A versatile artist, Lamb is known for landscape, portrait, genre still-life and sporting art paintings.

Lamb was a member of the New York Water Color Club (absorbed by the American Water Color Society in 1941); ).; American Water Color Society; Washington Water Color Club; New Haven Paint and Clay Club; and the Boston Art Club.
