  "body": "Wickes was born in Hempstead, on Long Island, New York. Circa 1860, the family moved to California; however, the family returned to New York just prior to Ethel’s birth, and were living in Queens, New York in the 1880s. 1886 saw the family moving back to California and living in San Francisco. She was 17 when she seriously embarked on her art career.\n\nWickes is best known for her watercolors of California wildflowers and of geese. [](<>)Wickes first began painting wildflowers because her invalid mother liked them and had told Wickes of the wildflowers in the Mohawk Valley of New York State and in California. Later, she became known as the \"Goose-Girl\" after a painting of a girl tending her geese that sold in New York City at William Morris Gallery, New York in 1890. There also a number of landscapes included in her oeuvre.\n\nIn 1897 she traveled to Europe where, in Paris, France, she studied oil and watercolor portrait painting at the Académie Colarossi with Gustave Claude Courtois, Louis Auguste Girardot, and Rene Francois Xavier Prinet and briefly at the Académie Julian with William Adolphe Bouguereau and Gabriel Ferrier. Wickes also made a sketching trip through England, Holland and Ireland. She returned to the United States in 1900 and painted briefly in a studio she had in New York City before she returned to San Francisco; however, after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, she moved to Pacific Grove in 1907, but returned to San Francisco in 1909.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1918, Wickes, with her two artist sisters, ran the Wickes Studio out of her home on Webster Street. In the late 1920s, Wickes, with one of her sisters, opened the Ethel M. Wickes School of Painting on Kearny Street in San Francisco.\n\nWickes exhibited at the Morris Gallery (NYC, 1890); San Francisco Art Association (1898-1901); Seattle Art Association (1911); Calif. State Fair, (1900-02, 1917-medal); Newport Garden Club, (RI, 1919-solo); Fairmont Hotel (San Francisco, 1925); Stanford University (1925-solo); Worden Gallery (San Francisco, 1926, 1929-solos); Everhardt Museum (Scranton, PA, 1929-solo); De Young Museum (San Francisco, 1933 & 1940-solos); Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood, 1935); Chico State College Chico, CA, 1939); and the Golden Gate International Exhibition (1939).\n\nH﻿igh auction record for this artist: $11,520",
