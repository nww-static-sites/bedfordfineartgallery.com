  "body": "Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cochran moved to Woodstock, New York and became a member of the early 20th century “utopian” Byrdcliffe Art Colony there. He took instruction from tonalist painter, Birge Harrison and Kenyon Cox.  Cochran adopted the tonalist style of the colony; however, it is his crisp, frosty snow scenes, such as “A   New England Winter” for which he was to become best known. \n\nA nexus of the tenets of John Ruskin’s “truth to nature” and the American arts and crafts movement of the early 20th century, his landscapes are a significant contribution to early 20th century American plein painting. Cochran was a member of the Woodstock Artists Association and the Salmagundi Club (NYC). He exhibited at the National Academy of Design, The Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C); the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\n\nH﻿igh auction record for this artist: $22,705.",
