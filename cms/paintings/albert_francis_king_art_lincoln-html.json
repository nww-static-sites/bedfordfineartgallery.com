  "body": "Albert Francis King was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and although he is best known today for his still-lifes, he was much sought after as a portrait painter.  King, was a popular Pittsburgh artist and painted portraits of the Pittsburgh’s bank presidents, business officials, and other leading citizens.  \"King gets the best likeness\", was the explanation of those who commissioned him.  Many of his portraits hung in the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh.  King was largely self-taught, but studied under Martin B. Leisser, a noted Scalp-Level landscape artist.  King also painted landscapes and painted at Scalp Level with Leisser and Scalp Level School of painting founder, George Hetzel.  King was a member of the Pittsburgh Art Society and the Pittsburgh Art Association.  This portrait of the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, is a fine example of King’s skills as a portraitist.  Painted in 1937 from photographs, it clearly shows that he maintained a steady hand into his later years. \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $43,750.",
