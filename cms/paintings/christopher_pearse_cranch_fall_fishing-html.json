  "body": "Christopher Pearse Cranch was born in Washington, D.C., the son of the Chief Justice of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.  Cranch briefly studied art with his brother, noted portrait painter, John Cranch, before attending Columbian College (now George Washington University) and later, Harvard Divinity School.  An ordained minister, he led an itinerant early life, tending to congregations in Maine, Virginia, the District of Columbia, Missouri, Ohio, Kentucky and Massachusetts.  He became involved with the nascent Transcendentalist movement, which would have put him at odds with the Unitarian Church.  By 1840, he had given up the ministry and returned to art, notable landscape painting.\n\nWith the support of his wife, who encouraged him to pursue painting, they left for Italy and during a later trip they lived in Paris where he made jaunts to Switzerland, Italy and the French countryside to make sketches.  Although considered an artist of the Hudson River School, he was an advocate of the Barbizon School of landscape painting.  Prior to his studies abroad, Cranch sketched with Hudson River artists Jasper Cropsey and Asher B. Durand.  Cranch’s landscapes were artistic manifestations that illustrate the connection between a continually changing nature and spirituality, paralleling the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.  Between 1863 and 1873, Cranch lived in Fishkill, NY and kept a studio on Broadway in New York City.\n\nHe exhibited regularly at the National Academy of Design and was made a full member in 1864.  In later years, he turned to poetry, for which he is better known.  An exhibition in 2007 at the Lyman Allyn Art Museum (New London, Connecticut) entitled, “At Home and Abroad: The Transcendental Landscapes of Christopher Pearse Cranch (1813 - 1832)” commemorated this important, nearly forgotten 19th Century artist.\n\nH﻿igh auction record for this artist: $10,000.",
