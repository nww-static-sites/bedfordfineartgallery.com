  "body": "Huntington was regarded as the successor to both Hudson River School founder, Thomas Cole and history painter, Washington Allston.  He was a distant relative of American historical painter, John Trumbull.  Huntington was educated at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he met portraitist Charles Loring Elliot.  Elliot encouraged him to study under artist and inventor, Samuel F. B. Morse.  Huntington had a passion for art, nature, and religion, a passion that he incorporated into his art.  He believed that art is composed of a trinity of sense, intellect and spirit.\n\nAfter traveling to Europe to study the Masters, he set up residence in New York City where his skill in portraiture led to his becoming the portraitist of New York Society.  A skilled landscapist as well, Huntington had a wide circle of supporters who arranged a retrospective exhibition of his works, the first one-man shown for a living artist in New York City.  He served as president of the National Academy of Design from 1862 to 1870, and again from 1877 to 1890.  Huntington also served as vice president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nHï»¿igh auction record for this artist: $406,000.",
