  "body": "Witucki is a sought-after oil painter who focuses primarily on the genre of still life. He is a self-taught artist who’s highly rendered work is reminiscent of the old masters. The use of dramatic light on his subjects brings an intimacy to his compositions. Witucki obtained his BS and MS in Visual Art Education from the State University of NY at Buffalo State. He is always focused on developing his skills in the techniques of the traditional masters with a strong interest in the Hudson River School and Dutch Still Life painters. Like these traditions Witucki chooses to focus on painting directly from life or from studies that have been created this way. He has been a drawing and painting instructor at the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts since 2002\n\nWitucki reveals a personal expression of landscapes and still lifes which pay homage to his formative years. He spent much of his boyhood roaming the fields and woods on the edge of the Berkshire Mountains in Monson, Massachusetts. This is where his understanding of the natural world took its roots. This influence plays a major role in the subjects of his work. Witucki is a member of the Copley Society of Artists, Buffalo Society of Artists, Oil painters of America, Western New York Artist Group and is a Grand Central Atelier, Hudson River Fellow. Sean has lives in Western New York with his wife and two children.",
