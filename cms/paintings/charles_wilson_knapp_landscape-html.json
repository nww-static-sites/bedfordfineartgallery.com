  "body": "Knapp was born in Philadelphia, PA, which was to remain his primary residence throughout his lifetime.  In 1880 his address was listed as 1510 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA.  Little is known of his art training; however, his skill cannot be denied.  Known primarily for his exquisite landscapes in the style of the Hudson River School, Knapp also painted coastal scenes, animals (chiefly cattle), and panoramas.  He resided in New York City from 1859 to 1861 and had exhibited his first painting at the National Academy of Design in 1859.  He worked primarily in Pennsylvania (Susquehanna River Valley, Poconos, Delaware Water Gap), New York State (Catskill and Adirondack Mountains, Hudson River Valley), and New Jersey (shore), but made excursions into New Hampshire (West Campton, Franconia Notch, and the White Mountains) and can be considered a member of the “White Mountain Painters”.   Knapp spent some time in Rhode Island where he painted scenes around Narragansett Bay and visited the Allegheny Mountain region of western Pennsylvania.  In addition to the National Academy of Design, Knapp exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanics Association (1878). ",
