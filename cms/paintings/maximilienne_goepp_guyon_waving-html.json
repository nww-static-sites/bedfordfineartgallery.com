She exhibited often, primarily in France, and won numerous awards, receiving the traveling purse in 1894, the first woman to whom it was given.\n\nShe was held in high regard as a teacher, instructing the Princess Mathilde (of Saxony), who in her own right became a talented artist.\n\nMme. Guyon was a successful portrait painter, having the ability to “unmask” the subject by artfully rendering individual characteristics of which they were previously unaware. \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $9,770.",
