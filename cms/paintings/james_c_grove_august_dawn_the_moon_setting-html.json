  "body": "Noted for his large, highly-detailed grand-view geographic oil landscapes, James C. Groves is a contemporary practitioner of the 'Grand Landscape', a manner of painting common to America's 19th century Frederic Church, Albert Bierstadt, and Thomas Moran. Born in Fairmont, W.V., the painter began drawing at age 3, began water coloring at age 4, and oil painting by age 9. The artist graduated from Frostburg State College (1973) with degrees in Geography, Psychology and Education. After a 2-year sidetrack as a Geography teacher, Mr. Groves began practicing his craft professionally. Having spent nearly 8 years and thousands of hours, in the 1970's and 80's, visiting and studying at Washington, D.C.'s major galleries, Mr. Groves became primarily adept at utilizing the amazing painting techniques of America's 19th Century Hudson River Painters.\n\nIn the 1980's, Groves began delving into the methodologies of the much-older schools of oil painting. Out of this lengthy study came a multitude of findings, which has allowed the painter a scope of knowledge concerning traditional oil painting practice and materials. His careful gleanings and re-creation of numerous 'lost' painting methods and mediums have had a notable influence in the artworld. A full-time painter, Groves paints almost daily, 'rubbing up' his own oil paints just before use. His masterful creations display a thorough knowledge and understanding of historical oil painting method and materials. His command at depiction of the various landscape elements -- sky, weather, land, vegetation, water, mountains-- is second to none. Additionally, and pervasive to the whole, Groves' originals achieve life from these elements through a curious 3-dimensional character ; a rare trait that allows viewers to look' into' the painted landscape, rather than simply at it.",
