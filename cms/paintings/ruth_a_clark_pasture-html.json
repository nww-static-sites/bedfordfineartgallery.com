  "body": "Little is known of Ruth Clark’s art training and there is very little biographical information available, other than that she was in Alameda, California in 1912.  That Clark was a talented artist cannot be questioned.  This painting illustrates her skill in composition—horses rendered in exquisite detail.  The background contains a delightful accent--a mule, also painted in exacting detail.",
