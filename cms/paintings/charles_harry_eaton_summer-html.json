  "body": "Charles Henry Eaton is known primarily for his prize-winning water-colors.  He was a self-taught painter, who developed what some describe as a “sultry, low-toned style”, in the manner of tonalism.  His landscapes do not emphasize the minute detail of a scene, but serve to capture the spirit of the place, in the fashion of George Inness.  The “Last Days of Summer”, marvelously captures his low-toned style to the extent that you sense the last gasp of summer.  Eaton exhibited widely—Exposition Universelle; World’s Columbian Exposition; American Water Color Society; Boston Art Club, Brooklyn Art Association; Lotos Club; National Academy of Design and the Western Art Association.\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $19,200.",
