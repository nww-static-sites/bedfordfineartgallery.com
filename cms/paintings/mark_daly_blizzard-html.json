  "body": "Contemporary Impressionist artist Daly says of himself “I paint life’s joys. I feel truly blessed to be able to create and share happiness through oil paint. My visual stories are revealed through impressions of city, boat, beach, and other memorable scenes.\" \n\nDaly was born on Long Island, New York.  As a child his mother taught him drawing and he spent time in the studio of artist Woodhull Young at Huntington Harbor watching the boats and fishermen while listening to Woodhull’s travel stories. More recently Daly has considered plein air landscape painter C.W. Mundy as his mentor. Daly maintains studios in Maine and Ohio and travels widely.\n\nHis earlier career included graduating from Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences (Ithaca, NY) and receiving a master's degree from The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business (Philadelphia).  His experiences in business have resulted in Daly’s authoring of two books -- *Ten Treasures Strategic Playbook: The Map to Enduring Business Success* and *Five Steps to Board Success: New Approaches to Board Effectiveness and Business Success.*  He also writes music for and plays the mandolin.  \n\nHe has exhibited at Cincinnati Art Galleries (2014, solo); American Impressionist Society's 14th National Exhibition (2013, Charleston, South Carolina, Dickinson Signature Award); Cincinnati Art Club ViewPoint 45 (2013, gold medal); Cincinnati Art Club ViewPoint 44 (2012, Viewpoint Excellence Award); Cincinnati Art Galleries (2012, \"The Musician's Paintbrush\", solo); The American Impressionist Society's 12th Annual National Juried Exhibition (2011, Carmel, California); Cincinnati Art Galleries (2010, \"Conversations with Nature\", solo); and Oil Painters of America Eastern Regional Show (Jacksonville, Florida). \n\nHe serves on the Board of Directors and is a member of the American Impressionist Society (AIS) and the American Society of Marine Artists (ASMA), Salmagundi Club, Greenacres Artist Guild, and Oil Painters of America (OPA).",
