  "body": "Car was born in England in 1837; however, not much is known of Carr’s early life and art training before he immigrated to the United States circa 1865. We can surmise that he had studied art in England as his work in the United States reveals at least modicum of professional schooling in art. Carr lived with his sister and brother-in-law in Brooklyn and shared a studio with landscape painter Clinton Loveridge. He was best known for his depictions of children engaged in a variety of their youthful activities, pastoral scenes and beach scenes, the latter of which is best represented by a series of small Coney Island beach scenes completed, between 1879 and 1880.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, America’s beaches, such as Coney Island, became popular as family resorts and Carr depicted the sights of children at play, strolling photographers, and the acrobats and puppeteers who wandered the beach in search of an audience. As “holidays at the sea” had been a popular subject among British genre painters, it is not surprising that Carr would engage in a similar theme.\n\nSome writes have suggested the Carr used photographs to paint his Coney Island beach scenes; however, it is more likely that, according to Elizabeth Garrity Ellis, the somewhat orderly progression of these scenes was due to the influence of the *camera obscura,* a devise located in a pavilion there, that used mirrors to project real-time images from areas of Coney Island onto a screen – a sort of 19th century “movie.” Carr shifted from his beach scenes to pastoral scenes and landscapes in the 1890s. Both he and Clinton Loveridge made their living from bucolic landscapes with cows, sheep, or goats, which very popular during the mid-to-late nineteenth century.\n\nCarr was a member of the Brooklyn Art Club (pres.) and he exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association (1871-89, 1891); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Philadelphia, 881-90); and National Academy of Design (1889-94, as S.S. Carr).",
