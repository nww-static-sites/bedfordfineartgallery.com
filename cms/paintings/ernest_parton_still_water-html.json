  "body": "Ernest Parton was born in Hudson, New York, a city located along the Hudson River. His older brother was artist Arthur Parton, with whom Ernest would accompany on sketching excursions along the nearby Hudson River and into the Catskill Mountains as a youth. In lieu of formal art training, Parton benefitted from his brother’s tutelage and that of his artist friends which provided him with a solid foundation on which to build and improve on his natural talent.\n\nFor two winters in the mid-1860s, he shared a studio with his brother in New York City and circa 1869 he traveled to Europe, visiting England, Wales, Scotland and France, where he became acquainted with the artists of the Barbizon School of plein air painters. Parton met with great success in England and in 1873, he decided to remain there. He lived in St. John’s Wood in Northern London, which would be his home until 1932; moving back to New York just prior to his death in 1933.\n\nIn the 1870s, he visited Italy and Switzerland making sketches and joined a circle of American and English artists who gathered to paint in the French village of Grez-sur-loing, near Barbizon during the summer.  His landscapes are a synthesis of his early training in the style of the Hudson River artists and that of his later exposure to the French Barbizon artists.\n\nAlthough London based, Parton visited New York and painted landscapes while there, and would send paintings to a number of the major American Expositions and other American venues, as well as those in France. Parton was a member of the Artists Fund Society and Royal Institute of Painters, London. He exhibited at the National Academy of Design (NYC, 1866-97); Royal Academy (1875 – 1932); Paris Exposition (1889, 1890); Paris Salon (1892, 1894); Chicago World’s Fair (1892); World’s Columbian Exposition (1893); and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Philadelphia, PA, 1905).\n\nH﻿Igh auction record for this artist: $23,500",
