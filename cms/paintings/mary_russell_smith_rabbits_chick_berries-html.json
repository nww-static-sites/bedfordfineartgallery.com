  "body": "Mary Russell Smith was born at Rockhill, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her parents were the artists Russell Smith and Mary Priscilla Smith. As a child, she sketched from nature, drawing the animals and insects she saw while playing. Mary’s favorite pastime since early childhood was raising poultry, a hobby that led her to specialize in painting small, highly detailed compositions of chickens, for which now she is best known. Her father Russell Smith said of his daughter that “such habits early in life no doubt laid the foundation of that strong love of nature that was more a passion than a predilection, and remained the ruling principal of her life and art.”\n\nIn 1851, when Mary was nine, she accompanied her parents and her brother, artist Xanthus Smith, to Europe. At age 13 (1865), she accompanied her brother to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and made sketches of the battlefield. It was about this time that she began painting in oil. In 1867 they visited New York City.\n\nRegardless of these experiences, Mary remained steadfast to her depiction of chickens—art critic Henry Tuckerman stated that her paintings were “remarkable for grace, fidelity, and skill in delineation of the feathered tribe – her special branch.” She also painted rabbits, dogs, squirrels, opossums and birds.\n\nIn 1868 Mary exhibited two paintings at the National Academy of Design in New York City. She saw early success and Philadelphians were eager to purchase her paintings; however, her sales were not confined to Philadelphia—in 1870, she was working on “chicken” paintings for patrons in London. In 1876 she exhibited her painting “Cluck and Chickens” at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia.\n\nShe never married and suffered with ill health throughout her life and lived and painted out of the Smith family home at Edgehill. In 1874 she suffered from measles and eye trouble which caused her to cease painting for a year. Mary strongly supported women artists in Philadelphia and, she designated that a portion of her painting sales go toward creating an annual award for women.\n\nAfter her early death in 1878, her father, through the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts established the Mary Smith Prize to be awarded on the basis of originality of subject, beauty of design or drawing, color and effect, and execution. It was awarded each year until 1969.\n\nH﻿igh auction record for this artist: $25,740.",
