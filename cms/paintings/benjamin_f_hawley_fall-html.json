  "body": "There is very little biographical information available for Hawley, other than he lived, and was active in Pennsylvania in the early 20th century.  He is known to have studied at the Academie Julian (Paris, France) and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.  Also very few paintings by him are known to exist.  What are available show him to be a skilled landscapist, in a style somewhat reminiscent of the Hudson River School.  That his profession was as an artist is not in doubt as he is listed in Who was Who in American Art (Falk, 1999).",
