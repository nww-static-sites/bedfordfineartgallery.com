  "body": "Albert Francis King was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and was recognized as Pittsburgh’s primary still-life painter during the 19th century. King was largely self-taught, but studied under Martin B. Leisser, a noted Scalp-Level landscape artist. Although he is best known for his still-lifes, he was much sought after as a portrait painter and painted many of the prominent citizens of Pittsburgh, including composer Stephen Foster. Many of his portraits hung in the Duquesne Club in Pittsburgh. His still-life compositions included, fruit (especially watermelons), vegetables and fish depicting meal preparation, similar to those by Jean-Bapiste-Simeon Chardin, a great 18th century French still-life painter. King also painted landscapes and painted at Scalp Level with Leisser and Scalp Level School of painting founder, George Hetzel. King was a member of the Pittsburgh Art Society and the Pittsburgh Art Association.",
