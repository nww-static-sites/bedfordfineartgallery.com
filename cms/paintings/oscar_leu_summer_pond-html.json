  "body": "Landscape painter Oscar Leu was born in in Dusseldorf, Germany. Very little biographical information is currently available for him; however, he was a student of his father, landscape painter, August Leu, as was his brother, Otto Leu. Leu also studied at the Academy of Arts in Berlin and the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich with Karl Raupp. Leu specialized in landscapes and likely took sketching trips, perhaps with his brother, through Italy and Switzerland and possibly to Lake Chiemsee in Bavaria, which was Rauppâ€™s favorite haunt.",
