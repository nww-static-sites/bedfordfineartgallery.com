  "body": "Exene Reed Meyersham was born in Northville, Michigan, but she is more closely associated with Rhode Island and Massachusettsas an artist.  She studied at the Rhode Island School of Design, Boston School of the Fine Arts and with Charles Hawthorne at Provincetown, Massachusetts.  Charles Hawthorne, an award-winning artist and who founded the Cape Cod School of Art, once remarked that “painting is just one spot of color in relation to another spot.  Let color make form, do not make form and color it.”  That Meyersham was a talent artist is not in doubt; however, her precise application of paint somewhat belies Hawthornes’s statement.  John Curuby (Boston Art Club) describes her style as “very closely related to the last Modernist phase of the Boston School Impressionism”.  The Rohde Island Water Color Society has names an award in her honor.",
