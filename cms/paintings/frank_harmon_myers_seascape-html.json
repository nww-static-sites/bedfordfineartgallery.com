In 1923, Myers studied at the L'Académie Americaine des Beaux-Arts under the guidance of historical/allegorical painter Auguste François-Marie Gorguet and Neoclassic painter Jean Despujols, at Fontainebleau, France; a school established with the aid of the United States after World War I.  In 1925 Myers returned to Europe on his honeymoon, traveling in France and Spain.  In 1926 the couple traveled to the American west and met Joseph Henry Sharp, the “father of the Taos Art Colony” and visited the Monterey Peninsula.  He taught at the Cincinnati Art Academy for 23 years made visits to Cape Ann and Rockport where he painted harbor scenes, and Taos, New Mexico.  Meyers permanently moved to Pacific Grove, near Monterey in 1940, where he built a studio and focused on painting seascapes.  Meyers was a prominent member of the Monterey art scene, along with other Armin C. Hansen and Donald Teague, and was president of the Carmel Art Association.  Meyers was a member of the Cincinnati Art Club; MacDowell Society; Carmel Art Association; Southwest Art and Society of Independent Artists.
