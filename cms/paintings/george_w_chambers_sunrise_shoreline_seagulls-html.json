  "body": "There is little biographical information available for Chambers. His death on some sources is left with a question mark; on other it is given as 1897, indicating that he died a relatively young man. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Chambers studied at the St. Louis School of Fine Art with Carl Gutherz. In 1880 he traveled to Paris, France to study with Jean Léon Gérôme. While there he also took study with Julien Dupré. Chambers returned to St. Louis in circa 1884 and taught at the School of Art for two years, before moving to Nashville, Tennessee.  In Nashville, he taught at the Watkins Institute, later becoming its director. Chambers painted the rural Tennessee landscape, often in the manner of the French Barbizon school. Some of his other paintings clearly show the imprint of his earlier academic training. Toward the end of his career, he became interested in the decorative arts and stained glass. Chambers exhibited: Paris Salon (1883-85); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1883, 1891-92); and the Art Institute of Chicago (1889).",
