  "body": "Lisa Geiger is a Wisconsin artist who exhibited artistic talent as a youth and always enjoyed working in creative mediums whether graphite, colored pencils, oil painting, pastels, watercolors, or the culinary arts.  Lisa has always perceived and appreciated the beauty in things whether it’s her surroundings or food.  Light, shadow, color, texture, and composition are careful considerations in her artwork. Lisa’s first and most important job was as a stay-at-home-mom; however, her artistic side always expressed itself in her creatively planned and artistically executed meals, much appreciated by her family. Now that her youngest child has become more independent and has gone off to college, she spends more time honing her craft, particularly oils, water colors and pastels. She works tirelessly and reads voraciously. She also attends classes taught by nationally renowned artists Joyce Hicks, Doug Dawson, Lois Griffel, Lee Mothes and David Cheifetz to challenge her abilities and to continue to improve her skills. Lisa’s works are mostly intimate florals and peaceful landscapes in which she strives to capture the true feeling of nature. All her works are from places that Lisa and her family have visited and reproduced from photographs or memories. Numerous works are of roadside scenes from rural Wisconsin between Appleton and their place in the Northwoods.  Lisa has exhibited the Secura Art Show in the 1990s and in August 2019 at Jack Richeson & Co., Inc. in Kimberly, Wisconsin. ",
