  "body": "Murphy was born in Oswego, New York. born in Oswego, on Lake Ontario, in Upstate New York.  In 1868, when he was fifteen, he moved to Chicago with his family and began his art career as a scene painter for a local theatre. While in Chicago, Murphy likely had taken some art classes at the Chicago Academy of Design; he was elected as an Academy Associate in1873and shortly thereafter, an Academician.  Sales of his paintings enabled Murphy to travel to the Adirondack Mountains, where he spent a great deal of his time painting in the Keene Valley.  In 1875 Murphy moved to New York City because he believed that Chicago did not sufficiently support its artists. This proved to be a good move as the National Academy of Design accepted one of his paintings in 1876, followed, in 1879, by one of his watercolors being accepted for exhibition by the American Water Color Society. Murphy married artist Adah Clifford Smith in 1883 and they moved into the newly constructed Hotel Chelsea in Manhattan. Murphy initially painted in the romantic manner of the Hudson River School artists; however, in the late 1880s, likely after a trip to Barbizon, France in 1886, he became more influenced by the Barbizon style.  After their return, the Murphys built a home and studio in Arkville New York, where they would spend their summers until Murphy’s death in 1921.  Murphy was to become a leader among the United States’ Tonalist painters, much like Alexander Wyant who was to move to Arkville a couple of years after the Murphys. During the first decade of the 1900s the Murphys traveled to England, Scotland, and Norway and about this time, Murphy moved to a higher-keyed palette, but still maintaining a limited range of hues, to produce rather stark, yet harmoniously appealing, tonal landscapes. Murphy was a member of the National Academy of design (Associate, 1885; Academician, 1887); Society of American Artist (1901); American Water Color Society (1880) and the Salmagundi Club (1878). He exhibited at the National Academy of Design (1876-1921; 1885, Hallgarten Prize; 1910, gold medal); Brooklyn Art Association (1881-1909); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1884-85, 1898-1901, 1908-11, 1916, 1921); Society of American Artists (1887, prize; 1902, prize); World’s Columbian Exposition (1893, medal); American Water Color Society (1894, prize); Art Club of Philadelphia (1899, gold); Paris Exposition (1900); Pan-American Exposition (1901, Buffalo, NY, medal);Charleston Exposition (1904, medal); Corcoran Gallery biennials (six times between 1907 – 1919); Salmagundi Club (1911, prize) and Pan-Pacific Exposition (1915, San Francisco, medal).",
