  "body": "Bussman was a member of the second-generation of the Scalp Level School, a group of artists that painted with George Hetzel at Paint Creek near Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Not much is known about him, but it is known that he exhibited two paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1876. Both of these paintings are of the Paint Creek area--Little Falls on Paint Creek, Near Johnstown, Pennsylvania (No. 190) and On Paint Creek (No. 282).  We believe that this painting may be Little Falls on Paint Creek, Near Johnstown, Pennsylvania. In 1878, Bussman again exhibited two paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts—A Bunch of Grapes (No. 127) and View on White Clay Creek, Near Wilmington, Del. (No. 195). In 1891, the Pittsburgh Dispatch newspaper noted that one of Bussman’s paintings was hung in the ladies parlor of the new clubroom of the Mozart Club located in the Hostetter Building on Fourth Avenue.\n\nDuring the 1880s and the 1890s Bussman was mentioned frequently in newspaper stories, not for his paintings, but for his fine singing voice—he was referred to as “Pittsburgh’s noted Tenor.” However, in 1886 the New Castle Daily City News mentioned that “Prof. F. J. Bussman was engaged in sketching at Wurtemburg” (Lawrence County, Pennsylvania). A professor in what field, we do not know—perhaps music. In 1929 the Princeton Daily Princetonian listed J. F. Bussman’s name under “The following members of the faculty and students have mail at the Princeton Post Office which is incorrectly addressed.” It remains a mystery for now.",
