  "body": "Giuseppe Luigi Carlo Benevenuto Lucioni was born in Malnate, in the mountainous region of northern Italy. At the age of six, his teacher noticed his artistic talent and encouraged him to pursue drawing and etching. In 1906, his father, a coppersmith, moved to New York City; however, Lucioni’s mother having heard about “savages” in the United States, decided to take young Luigi to Milan and had him confirmed at the Duomo to protect his soul prior to embarking to the United States. In 1911 the family joined their father in his Manhattan apartment. However; his mother disliked New York City and upon a threat of returning to Malnate, the family moved to first to North Bergen, New Jersey and finally settled in Union City, New Jersey in 1929. As a teenager, he had taken private drawing classes in Jersey City prior to taking study at the Cooper Union Evening School in New York City from 1916 to 1920. Lucioni also studied at the National Academy of Design from 1920 to 1925 with caricaturist and etcher William Auerbach Levy and American Impressionist William Starkweather. During this time, he was an etcher employed by the New York Herald Tribune. And worked in the art department at Fairchild Publications 1924 Lucioni received a scholarship from the Tiffany Foundation which allowed him access to Laurelton Hall, Louis Comfort Tiffany’s grand home and gardens on Long Island, to paint. This was followed a trip to Europe in 1925 where he was to study the art of the early Italian Renaissance painters and the still-lifes of French post-Impressionist artist Paul Cezanne. When he returned to the United States, he opened a studio in Washington Square (Greenwich Village), New York Cit—one that he maintained until 1945. Cezanne’s style may have influenced Lucioni’s still-life paintings; however, he never ventured any further into the “modernism” that was beginning to influence art in the United States. In a 1979 interview with Robert Brown, Lucioni said that “…I never worried about whether I was stylish or not stylish. It didn’t make any difference to me. I just feel you do what you do, you are what you are.” And so, he did, and was. He first visited Vermont in 192, the hills reminding him of his early home in Italy. In 1939, he purchased a home in Manchester Depot where he spent his summers. He spent his last years in Union City where he died in 1988. Lucioni was a member of the National Academy of Design; Southern Vermont Artists and; the Society of American Etchers. He exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1928-1944); Allied Artists of America (1929); Whitney Museum of American Art (1932-1941); CI (1936, prize); Corcoran Galleries biennials (1928-1953); LOC (1946); National Academy of Design (1957, purchase prize); Milch Gal., (NYC, 1970s); TMA; Herron Art Institute of Chicago; Art Institute of Chicago; Venice Biennale (Italy); Richard York Gallery (NYC, still-lifes, 1991).",
