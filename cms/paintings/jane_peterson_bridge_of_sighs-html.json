In 1907 she travelled to Europe where she studied with Frank Brangwyn (London), Jacques Emile Blanche and Andre L'Hote (Paris).  Her solo exhibition at the Société des Artistes Français in 1908 resulted in an admirer setting up another exhibition of her work at the St. Botolph club in Boston in 1909.  She made a second trip to Europe in 1909 where she spent time with Joaquin Sorolla in Madrid, Spain, followed by a solo trip to North Africa, visiting Egypt and Algiers in 1910.

Afterwards she settled in Gloucester, MA and painting scenes at Martha’s Vineyard, and Ogunquit and Rockport, ME.
