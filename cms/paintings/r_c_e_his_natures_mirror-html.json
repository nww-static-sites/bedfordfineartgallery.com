  "body": "The somewhat reclusive landscape painter, Rene Charle Edmond His was born in Colombes, Hauts-de-Seine, France. Although very little biographical information is available, it is known that he took study with Tony Robert-Fleury, Jules Lefebvre, and Henri Biva. He remained close to his Paris environs but traveled to the coast of Provence (France) and Algeria.\n\nTrue to his early academic training, he maintained a realist style in his landscape paintings even after new art movements developed near the turn of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. Not well known in the United States, his river landscapes were received favorably by in France and Great Britain and sold well.\n\nHisâ€™s skill with brush and color, and handling of light adds a sense of the sublime to his landscape paintings.\n\nHis was a member of the Societe des Artistes Francais and exhibited at the primary French venues throughout his life, including the Societe des Artistes Francais (1897, commendation; 1900, bronze medal); Academie des Beaux-Arts (1898, Prix Brizard); Paris Salon (1898, honorable mention); L'Exposition Universelle (1900).\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $133,390.",
