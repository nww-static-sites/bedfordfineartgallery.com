  "body": "Strahalm was born in Vienna, Austria, the son of a Viennese artist.  He received his early training from his father and later studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.  In 1909 he immigrated to Mexico. In 1911 he went to Texas, moving first to San Antonio, then Houston and finally Dallas, where he became was to become known one of the leading artists of the country in the 1920s and 1930s, specializing in landscapes, especially scenes near Dallas.  Strahalm made trips to sketch and paint along the Colorado and Pecos rivers in 1926 and in 1927, his son accompanied him to New Mexico where they spent several weeks at the Santa Fe art colony and Taos to paint Indian villages.  Strahalm had little sympathy for the so-called “modern trend” of painting of the time and believed its extremes will doom it to a short life.  He said of it ““It is but a passing phase, and most people who pretend to understand and admire it, do it to seem informed and up-to-date.”  Strahalm was a member of the Society of Independent Artists, the Southern Art League, the Dallas Art Association, and the Texas Fine Arts Association.  He exhibited at the Royal Academy at Vienna and the Paris Salons; Society of Independent Artists; throughout the U.S. Southwest and the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial International Exposition (1926, prize).  \n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $24,675.",
