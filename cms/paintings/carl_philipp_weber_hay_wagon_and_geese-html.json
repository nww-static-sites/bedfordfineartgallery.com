  "body": "Weber was born in Darmstadt, Germany and immigrated to Philadelphia, PA in 1853 with his parents.  His father, also named Carl, was a musician and a music teacher.  His uncle was German artist Paul Weber who had also immigrated to Philadelphia a little earlier, who had a son also named Carl.  Cousin Carl was also an artist, which had led to some confusion as to which “Carl” painted a particular painting.  “Carl Philipp”, is known primarily for his luminist landscape paintings in oil, whereas, “Carl” is known primarily for his water color paintings.  As a young man, Carl Philipp returned to Germany where he studied under August Von Kreling, noted sculptor and muralist, and also under his uncle Paul who had returned to Germany permanently circa 1860.\n\nCarl Philipp returned to Philadelphia in 1874 where he lived with his father however, by the late 1800s he had established a studio at 1134 Arch Street.  He painted the scenic vistas of the Adirondack Mountains, including Lake George and the Hudson River Valley.  He was a member of the Artists Fund Society and the Boston Art Club, where he also exhibited.  Carl Philipp also exhibited at the National Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  His paintings have won awards internationally—London, England, and Sidney and Melbourne, Australia.\n\nH﻿igh auction price for this artist: $13,200.",
