  "body": "“Fanny” Burke was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the great-great granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States through her mother's side. The Burkes were a prominent Alexandria family and Fanny, who never married, opened an art studio in Alexandria in the 1890s. She was known for portrait and genre paintings, especially her well-executed paintings of George Washington, copies of those by William Joseph Williams (1759-1823). She was painting into the early 1930s and died in 1933. This genre painting, “The Tea Party,” by Burke is a rare find.",
