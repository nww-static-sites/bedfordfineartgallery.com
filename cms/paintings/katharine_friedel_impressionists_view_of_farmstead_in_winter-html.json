  "body": "Freidel was a mid-century Pennsylvania artist. We found this charming little painting by her while traveling through western New York State. It is signed Katharine Friedel 1957. The frame gives the name of a Greensburg, Pennsylvania framing shop and we were told by the seller that the painting was from an estate in Erie, Pennsylvania. It just caught our eye. It is painted using a delightful color palette and impasto style that makes for a pleasing little winter scene. Itâ€™s perfect for that little niche in your home that needs brightening up.",
