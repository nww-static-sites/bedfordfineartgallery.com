  "body": "Friedel was a mid-century Pennsylvania artist. We found this charming little painting by her while traveling through western New York State. It is signed Katharine Friedel 1957. The frame gives the name of a Greensburg, Pennsylvania framing shop and we were told by the seller that the painting was from an estate in Erie, Pennsylvania. It just caught our eye. We're wondering if she painted this *en plein air.* It is painted using a delightful color palette and impasto style that makes for a pleasing little winter scene. It’s perfect for that little niche in your home that needs brightening up.",
