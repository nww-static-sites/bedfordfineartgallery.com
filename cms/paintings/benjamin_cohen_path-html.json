  "body": "An obscure, but equal in skill to his better-known contemporaries, Cohen is believed to be a Pennsylvania born artist. He is known to have painted the Brandywine River and exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1887. Why he slipped into obscurity could be the plot of a marvelously constructed “who done it” novel. Or perhaps, art may have been a hobby that he dabbled in from time to time, or worse, he may have died young before he had established his reputation. This painting depicts a man on horseback; his back is toward us, leaving the main road towards M. Glick’s. That’s probably Mr. Glick in the building working on horseshoes or other implements used by the local people. But that is not all there is to see. “M. Glick” appears on the sign above the door with a horseshoe at each end. Do you see the pile of wood and an old wheel propped against the fence? There is a man in a horse-drawn cart traveling towards us. Is this location near a crossroad? How can you tell? What other details pull you into the distance? Cohen was skilled in his use of detail, palette and effects to unwittingly draw you completely into the scene.",
