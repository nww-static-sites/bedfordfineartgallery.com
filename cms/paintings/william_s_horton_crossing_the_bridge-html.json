  "body": "Horton was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan and raised in Lisbon, North Dakota. As a youth he painted in secret because his wealthy parents, who strongly disapproved of him becoming an artist destroyed his paints and canvases. His pursuit of art led to him being estranged from his parents and later disinherited.\n\nAs a teen, Horton left home to study at the Art Institute of Chicago and was later hired as an illustrator for Northwest Magazine. He went on to New York City where he studied at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design.\n\nIn 1892 Horton married a wealthy New York Socialite Lottie Gray and they moved to Paris, France in 1893, where he continued his study at the Académie Julian with Benjamin Constant and J. P. Laurens. He was to become friends with Monet, Degas, Derain and Pissarro, among other noted French Impressionists. He exhibited his paintings in Paris; however, he seldom allowed his paintings to be sold.\n\nHorton and Lottie traveled throughout the United States and Europe, and his paintings of the snow-covered peaks of Gstaad, Switzerland earned him the sobriquet “greatest painter of snow who ever lived,” from Monet. \"Horton's work is a feast of color and light—(he) compares to Turner in his symphonic tendencies,\" said art critic Henri Fritsch Estrangin.\n\nHorton painted in a strong, confident and energetic manner and his later brushwork, although reminiscent of the pointillism of Pissarro, was true to his own sensitivities. He spent little time in the United States, preferring to live between London and Paris, making excursions to Venice in the summer and Switzerland in the Winter. After the death of Lottie in 1931, Horton traveled to China, Cuba, India and Scandinavia.\n\nHorton was a member of the New York Water Color Club; Salmagundi Club; American Federation of Arts; and Société Moderne Internationale Salon d’Automne.\n\nHe exhibited at the National Academy of Design (1888-1896); Boston Art Club (1890); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1890-1912, 9 times); Paris Salon (1895, 1897-1899); Gal. George Petit and Gal. Berheim Jeune (Paris, 1898-WWI, many solos); Art Institute of Chicago (1897-1909); International Exposition (Nantes, 1904, gold); Orlean (1905, medal).\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $104,500.",
