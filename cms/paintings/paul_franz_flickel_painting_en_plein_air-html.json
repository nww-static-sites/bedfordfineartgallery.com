  "body": "Flickel's forest scenes, described by German painter and art critic Ludwig Pietsch, imparted “all the secret poetic magic” with “sun-flashed shadow, under the golden green leaf roof of German beech and oak groves.” \n\nFlickel was born in Berlin. At age 16, he began his art studies in the workshop of his maternal grandfather, decoration painter, Carl Gropius. Flickel then studied with Theodor Hagen in Weimar, the founder of German Impressionism.\n\nIn 1876, Flickel became a resident of Berlin where he regularly exhibited at the Berlin Art Academy. He was to become a noted, award-winning, German plein air painter, making trips through Austria and Germany and, later, Italy.\n\nFrom 1892 to 1903 Flickel was a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, and in 1894 he was appointed professor. He also began exhibiting at the Grobe Berliner Kunstausstellung (Great Berlin Art Exhibition) when it was formed in 1893. Flickel died at Nervi, near Genoa, Italy, in 1903.",
