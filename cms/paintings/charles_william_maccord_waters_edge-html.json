  "body": "MacCord resided in Allegheny City, now the North Side of the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and would have shared those environs with such notables as artist Mary Cassatt, “modern” dancer Martha Graham, avant-garde writer Gertrude Stein, Hollywood actor William Powell, not to mention Pittsburgh icons Andrew Carnegie, H.J. Heinz, and Henry Phipps. MacCord specialized in genre and landscapes. In this painting, done in the Impressionist style, he used short brush strokes of paint to achieve a heightened light effect. The reflection of the sky in the pond illustrates MacCord’s application of this technique. He was a member of the Salmagundi Club and the Society of Independent artists. He exhibited at the National Academy of Design and the Society of Independent Artists.",
