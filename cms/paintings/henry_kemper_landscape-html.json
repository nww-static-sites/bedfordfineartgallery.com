He had made at least one excursion to the Adirondack Mountains and Lake George areas and is also known to have painted the scenic Ohio River Valley.  This appealing painting, titled simply “Landscape”, illustrates Kemper’s skill at capturing light and mood.\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $7,487.",
