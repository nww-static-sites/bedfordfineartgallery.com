  "body": "Johnstown, Pennsylvania artist Michael Mosorjak is a contemporary artist practicing in oil and gouache painting techniques. His skillful, realistic renderings have not only gained him a following among art collectors, but as an instructor of art history and basic drawing (Mount Aloysius College, Cresson, PA, painting technique and materials, Montserrat College of Art, Beverly, MA,); and lecturer on painting conservation (Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Indiana, PA and Boston University, Boston, MA).\n\nIn addition to his painting and teaching, Michael is a skilled art conservationist for both private collectors and public museums (The Western Center for Art Conservation, Denver, CO; Art Conservation Laboratory, Raymond, NH; and Westmoreland Museum of American Art, Greensburg, PA). Michael received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Painting and Printmaking (Boston University, Boston, MA), and a Master of Fine Arts in Painting Conservation – Dominican University, River Forest. IL, and Villa Schifanoia Graduate School of Fine Arts (Florence, Italy). His thesis was *The Practice of Picture Cleaning in Oil and Tempera Mediums*. He has authored two books, *Why Do?... A Book of Answers,* and an autobiography, *Fifty Years a Conservator of Paintings*. Michael’s paintings almost always contain an anomaly or a little mystery.",
