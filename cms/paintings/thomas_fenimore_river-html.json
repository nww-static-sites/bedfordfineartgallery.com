  "body": "In 1867, an art critic for the Philadelphia Inquirer said of Fenimore that “The career of this artist is steadily upward, and it is reasonable to expect that he is destined to occupy a position in the profession highly honorable.”  Philadelphia landscape painter Fenimore had started as a house painter, but by 1861 he was exhibiting his paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  He clearly was drawn to the scenic vistas of the White Mountains of New Hampshire, and he likely stayed, and worked with, the artists of the nearby North Conway art colony.  Fenimore painted scenes of Mount Washington, the Saco River, and Cathedral Ledge, which he exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1861 to 1869) and the Philadelphia Sketch Club (1867).  American art was deprived of one of its rising stars when, at the age of 31, Fenimore died of typhoid fever on July 31, 1873. ",
