   "body" : "Charles Armor is known primarily as a Washington, D.C. artist. Little is known of his art training or exhibitions; however, he was quite skilled as the painting above illustrates—note the tromp l’oeil effect of the knife in the foreground. Armor painted mostly still-lifes and landscapes; however, genre scenes and portraits by Armor can be found. The U.S. Department of the Interior has Armor’s work in their museum. He is listed in Davenport’s Art Reference (2005), The Artist’s Bluebook (L. Pierson, ed., 2005) and Who was Who in American Art (Falk, 1999).",
