  "body": "William Sidney Cooper studied with his great-uncle Thomas Sidney Cooper at his School of Art in Canterbury (now he University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury). Following in his great-uncle’s footsteps, the younger Cooper’s forte became cattle and sheep, which feature prominently in his watercolour and oil paintings.\n\nIn 1890 Cooper moved to Herne Bay in Kent where he painted the surrounding pastoral countryside with its herds of cattle and flocks of sheep. Cooper was an avid golfer and enjoyed playing tennis and lawn bowls. A capable musician, he played at local events.\n\nHe also apparently possessed architectural skills as he built a number of houses in Canterbury and the surrounding area of Alcroft Grange.\n\nCooper exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists, and the Royal Watercolour Society.\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $33,760.",
