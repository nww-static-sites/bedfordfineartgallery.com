  "body": "George Goodwin Kilburne was one of the most sought after artists in England. His early training as an engraver provided him with an eye for exacting detail, which served him later as a painter. He is best known as a genre painter and watercolourist. His paintings were often of the British upper classes and beautiful ultra-fashionable women. He executed his paintings with exquisite detail to not only the subject, but to their mode of dress and to their surroundings. After the death of Emperor Napoleon III in France, Kilburne was commissioned by Empress Eugenie to paint several pictures for her. Kilburne had accumulated a collection of arms and armour, which often appeared in his paintings.\n\nIn the late 1800s he designed and painted greeting and Christmas cards and also created black and white pictures for several British illustrated newspapers and magazines. Kilburne was elected a member of the New Watercolour Society, Royal Miniature Society, and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters. He exhibited at the Royal Academy, Royal Society of British Artists, New Watercolour Society, Royal Miniature Society, Grosvenor Gallery, Dowdeswell Galleries, Royal Birmingham Society of Artists, the Manchester Art Gallery, The Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and the Walker Art Gallery. Kilburneâ€™s works can be found in many public and private galleries.\n\nHigh auction record for this artist is $42,645.",
