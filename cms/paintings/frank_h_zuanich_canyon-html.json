  "body": "Zuanich was born in California, and was employed as an automobile salesman and painted only as a hobby. Although not a professional artist, his landscape compositions are realistic and well-executed. The above painting captures the grandeur and beauty of the Grand Canyon. This work is typical of the beauty in his landscape paintings that have been sold through fine venues such as Clars Auction Gallery (one of the West Coastâ€™s premier auction houses located in Oakland, California).",
