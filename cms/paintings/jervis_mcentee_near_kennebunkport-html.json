  "body": "McEntee was born in Rondout, New York in the Hudson River Valley. Poet Henry Pickering had boarded with the McEntee family when Jervis was young and likely had some influence on young Jervis’s path. During the winter of 1850 – 51, McEntee went to New York City and studied with Hudson River painter Frederick Church. He returned to Rondout where he opened a business; however, after a few years he gave up his business for an art career and, in 1858, he returned to New York City and opened a studio. His summers were spent in the river valleys and mountains of New York State, often with artist Worthington Whittredge, and returning to his studio in winter.\n\nAfter serving in the Union Army during the American Civil War, he traveled to Europe with artist Sanford Gifford, circa 1868, studying in the major galleries and painting in Italy and Switzerland. Recognized as a second-generation Hudson River School artist, Valentiner and Jaccaci in their 1911 book, *Old and Modern Masters in the Collection of M. C. D. Borden*, stated that “with few exceptions such as Whittredge and McEntee little real inspiration and no mastery of noble tradition distinguished the Hudson River painters, our debt to them is a great one, for they created an atmosphere in which the development of Martin, Inness and Wyant was possible.”\n\nIn *Art and Artists of Our Time*, Clarence Cook stated in 1888 that McEntee was the one of the first artist American artists to do justice to the expression of our autumnal scenery. Grant and Fiske in their 1888, *Appletons' 'Cyclopedia of American Biography*, state that “usually delineates Nature in her more sombre aspects, and there is in his paintings a latent sentiment not often found among landscape painters.\n\nMcEntee’s painting style changed from his earlier Hudson River style to the later style of the late 19th century Impressionists. McEntee was a member of National Academy of Design (associate,1860/academician, 1861) and the Century Association. He exhibited at the National Academy of Design (1861-90); Brooklyn Art Association (1862-82, 1886); Paris Exposition (1867); Boston Art Club (1873-91); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1876-77, 1885, 1887); Art Institute of Chicago (1880); Maryland Historical Society; Boston Atheneum; Brooklyn Art Association; and the Royal Academy, London.\n\n\n\nH﻿igh auction record for this artist: $288,00.",
