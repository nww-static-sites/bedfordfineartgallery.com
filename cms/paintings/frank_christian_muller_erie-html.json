  "body": "Muller was born in Denmark and immigrated to Baltimore Maryland in 1887.  From 1890 to until his death in 1938, he lived in Washington, D.C.  He at one time was employed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of entomology making paintings of insects.  Perhaps the works for which Muller is best known are his “portraits” of new battleships and naval battles for the Naval Archives of the Navy Department.  In addition, to his commissioned works, he appears to have had an affinity for the sea, as he painted marinescapes with some regularity.  Many of his paintings are displayed at the U.S. naval Academy.  Muller was member of the Society of Washington Artists, where he also exhibited, and he exhibited at the National Academy of Design. ",
