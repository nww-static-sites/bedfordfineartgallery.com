Lindsay.\n\n\n*\"There is about Lindsay a sincerity and honesty that is to be found in his\npictures, and never has he posed as anything that he is not. When the squabbles\nhave arisen among the artists, he has never taken a part in them, but followed\nthe even tenor of his own way; studied nature and painted her as he saw her,\nhonestly and without affectation. It is as a landscape painter that he will always\nbe known. His pictures that deal with nature, the humble tillers of the soil, and\nrude, uncouth men and women, are the ones which will always be known as\nrepresentative Lindsays. There is a large streak of the poetical in Mr. Lindsay,\nand it is the things with sentiment and poetry in them that he loves to paint.”\" –The Cincinnati Tribune, February, 23, 1896.*\n\n\nCincinnati, Ohio artist Thomas Corwin Lindsay, also known as T. C. Lindsay, who unlike other\nhighly skilled and well-known artists that Cincinnati produced during the nineteenth century,\nchose to remain in that city, instead of opting for New York, Philadelphia or Europe. For that, art\nafficionados of Cincinnati were thankful. As an art critic for the Cincinnati Commercial, wrote\non June 2, 1881: \"A few of our good artists have stayed with us, and are still at home. Among\nthese is the landscape painter Thomas C. Lindsay, whose artistic excellence has been recently\nmore recognized and appreciated than ever before.\"\n\n\nLindsay was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, however, his parents were both born in Pennsylvania. As a\nyoung child, Lindsay showed a decided talent for art. He drew pictures of everything he saw,\noften, to the displeasure of his father, on the walls of the family home! As a young man his\nnatural artistic instincts and skills were channeled through more appropriate avenues. In the Fall\nof 1858 autumn Lindsay embarked on a sketching trip through eastern Pennsylvania. The\nfollowing year, he opened a studio on West Fourth Street in Cincinnati and first exhibited a\npainting at the Ohio Mechanics’ Institute annual. That same year he joined the newly formed\nSketch Club.\n\n\nIn 1860, at age 18, he traveled to study at Düsseldorf, Germany according to some writers. If so,\nthen it was likely at the well-known and respected Dusseldorf Academy, where many other\nAmerican artists went to study. After his return, Lindsay made a second trip to the eastern United\nStates in 1862. In 1867 he traveled to Europe and spent two years in Paris. He returned to\nCincinnati is 1869. Lindsay believed \"that the most beautiful bits of nature are to be found\" in\nthe mountains of Pennsylvania and New York State and spent his summers there. His travels in\nthe east included the White Mountains in New Hampshire.\n\n\nFor a while, during the 1870s, Lindsay switched from painting landscapes to painting portraits,\nnot because of a desire to do so on his part, but most likely due to the Panic of 1873 and\nsubsequent depression that lasted for several years, which made portraiture more lucrative than\nlandscapes. Even an artist with Lindsay’s reputation found it difficult to made a living solely\nfrom his landscapes and many of his landscapes went to auction during this time. However, \\\nauctions also a way for Lindsay to finance his trips during the 1880s and 1890s. In 1881, Lindsay\nsent 23 of his landscapes to auction to finance another trip east, although, it may have for a trip\nto the western part of the United States, as he painted a number of western scenes – native\nAmericans and views of Yosemite. Another auction in 1891 was to finance a trip to the coast of\nMaine.\n\n\nAlthough many of his landscapes featured sheep and cows, he was well-known in Cincinnati for\nhis paintings of lions and tigers, where displayed in public places throughout the city. A large\npainting of a lion once hung in a Milwaukee hotel. Lindsay had used for the model a lion at the\nCincinnati Zoo. Other than the short-lived Sketch Club, Lindsay did not join any organizations,\nnor spend much time among his professional peers, although he exhibited frequently.\n\n\nLindsay did not subscribe to any particular \"technique\" when painting; it was probably his innate\nartistic instinct that determined his compositions and their execution – it was his own technique\nand it served him well for 30 years. You can see in his paintings that he did indeed \"study nature\nand painted her as he saw her with an honesty and without affectation.\"\n\n\nThe painter of ferocious lions and tigers was described after his death as “a lovable man, though\nnot a man to make friendships carelessly. He appeared reserved and in truth was reserved, but\nextremely frank and friendly with those who he liked.\n\n\nAnd, he was an honest man who painted honest pictures.\n\nWritten by Joan Hawk, Researcher and Co-Owner Bedford Fine Art Gallery, September 16, 2025\\\nUse only with the permission of Bedford Fine Art Gallery.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
