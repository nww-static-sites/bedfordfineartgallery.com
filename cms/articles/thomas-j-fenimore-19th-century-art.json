A young Fenimore had gotten his start in \"the arts\" by working as a house painter. I would speculate that that was what paid the bills until he could depend the sale of his paintings for a source of income. It would not be an overstatement to say that the young Fenimore had more than enough talent to make a name for himself among the Philadelphia artists of the 1860s. He did just that -- in 1861 at age 19, Fenimore began exhibiting his landscape paintings at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and would do so until 1869. These paintings would have included scenes along the Brandywine, Juniata, Schuylkill, Susquehanna rivers and Wissahickon Creek in Pennsylvania.\n\nFenimore did not confine his work to capturing the streams of Pennsylvania -- he painted scenes on the Hudson and Niagara rivers and Lake George in New York State, and traveled south into Virginia and West Virginia for views worthy of palette and canvas. It was circa 1866 that he began to make excursions to New Hampshire, notably the White Mountains. It is possible that he worked with the artists of the nearby North Conway art colony. Fenimore painted scenes of Mount Washington, the Saco River, Mount Chocorua and Cathedral Ledge. Many of his New Hampshire scenes were exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Sketch Club.\n\nFenimore’s palette, brushwork and handling of light rivaled that of the Hudson River School Artists. The American public was deprived of one of its rising landscape stars when, at the age of 31, Fenimore died of typhoid fever on July 31, 1873. \n\nWritten by Joan Hawk, Researcher and Co-Owner Bedford Fine Art Gallery, September 9, 2025.\n\nUse only with the permission of Bedford Fine Art Gallery.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
