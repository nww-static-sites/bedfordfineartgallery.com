Their **rich texture, depth, and luminosity** create a tactile, visceral experience.

They hold energy, intention, and presence.\n\n**Create a Healing Space with Art**\n\nThink about the space where you spend most of your time. Does it inspire you? Comfort you? Make you feel at peace?\n\nIntroducing an original oil painting into your environment can transform your room into a **healing sanctuary**.
