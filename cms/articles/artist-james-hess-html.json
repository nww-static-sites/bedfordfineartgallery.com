Hess presents many attractions as upon its walls are to be found many pictures that bear the stamp of originality of conception and marked artistic ability.\"(Pennsylvania Historical Review).\n\nHess, also known as James N. Hess, and most unfortunately and incorrectly, as John N. Hess, was a skilled Philadelphia animal and landscape artist. There is very little biographical information available regarding this skilled landscapist. It is known that he had contract typhoid fever as a child, which left him crippled and in poor health. Timelines are elusive for Hess; however, as a young man, in either the late 1870s or early 1880s, he received support from a local benefactor which allowed to study art at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Around this same time Hess worked as an illustrator for a number of Philadelphia lithography firms.\n\nHess had set up a studio on Chestnut Street, \"handsomely appointed,\" as stated above, and he exhibited at least one time at the Philadelphia Academy of the Fine Arts in 1882. In a city, which at the time had a number of fine “marine” painters, young Hess selected a less crowded field of endeavor – animal painting, especially horses, but cows and sheep also. He was a well-known artist in Philadelphia, accepting commissions and keeping a stock of well-executed paintings in his studio, which included some genre scenes and still-lifes.\n\nHenry Ossawa Tanner, the well-known black artist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, credits Hess with suggesting to him he become an animal painter. Tanner said that he learned from Hess “that animal painters were even less numerous than good marine painters, and we were even less represented in this field – so that in order that America should not always be in such a deplorable plight, I renounced this inviting field of \\[marine] painting to become an American Landseer.” Tanner did paint animals for a while. In fact, both Tanner and Hess painted the famous lion, Pompei, known as \"Pomp,\" a resident of the Philadelphia Zoo until 1884.\n\nPhotographic recordation of people, places and things was coming popular during Hess’s lifetime and Hess apparently at least dabbled in this new technology. A newspaper article noted that Hess and photographer Charles Crowthers were at the Philadelphia Zoo in 1886 photographing and studying wildlife.\n\nHess was not long a bright light in the annals of Philadelphia artistic history, he died at age 32, likely due to the lingering and deleterious effects of typhoid fever from which he had suffered as a youth.\n\nUse only with permission of Bedford Fine Art Gallery.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
