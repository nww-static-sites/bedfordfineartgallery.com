During this time, artists moved away from European influences and began to develop a distinctive American style, capturing the essence of the country's landscapes, people, and burgeoning cities.\n\n### Key Movements and Artists\n\nOne of the most significant movements of this era was the Hudson River School, characterized by its romantic and majestic portrayals of the American wilderness. Artists like [Henry Boese (American 1824-1897)](https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/henry_boese_artwork.html) – [A Hudson Valley Scene](https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/henry_boese_a_hudson_river_scene.html), [William Hart (American 1823-1894)](https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/william_hart_artwork.html) – [Hudson Valley Landscape](https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/william_hart_hudson_valley_landscape.html), and [Frederic Rondel (Sr. American 1826-1892)](https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/frederic_rondel_sr_artwork.html) – [Boating on the Hudson](https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/frederic_rondel_sr_boating.html) created grand, sweeping landscapes that celebrated the natural beauty of the Hudson River Valley and beyond.\n\nIn addition to [landscape paintings](https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/landscape_artwork.html), [genre paintings](https://www.bedfordfineartgallery.com/genre_artwork.html) also flourished.
