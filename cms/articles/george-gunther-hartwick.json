  "body": "Known variously as G. Hartwick; George G. Hartwick; Gunther Hartwick; G. G. Hartwick in the literature of the late 19th – early 20th centuries American art auction records, Hartwick was from Saxony, Germany, but came to the New York City circa 1847. Although most art literature, that includes his name, states that he is best known for his winter scenes. That may be true, as old exhibition catalogs list titles as \"Ice Skating Near East Rock, New Haven, Connecticut,\" \"A Winter in New England\" and \"Winter in Orange Valley, New York\" – American scenes; auction records include numerous Swiss scenes with titles \"Swiss Lake and Mountains\" and \"A Mountain Lake in the Tyrol,\" So winter scenes were part of his oeuvre; however, the records also show that Hartwick painted scenes of the Hudson River Valley, Catskill Mountains and Niagara Falls in New York State, Wissahickon Creek, Pennsylvania, and Bridal Veil Falls in the Yosemite Valley, among other spectacular scenes.\n\nShould he be included with the Hudson River School artists? Maybe. Hartwick was painting in New York during at the zenith of these artists and likely painted at some of the places they did, only with his artistic imprint. Nonetheless, the man could paint rocks and boulders convincingly well. Look at the boulders, rock-strewn slopes and rocky outcrops in his paintings. They rival those of the Hudson River School artists, in my opinion.\n\nHis works exhibit outstanding composition and contrasting textures. One of his paintings “Boulder Slope” (currently at the Bedford Fine Art Gallery) has a captured a moment in geological history. Hartwick has depicted a boulder perched somewhat precariously on a steep slope. The geologists among you (hopefully, there are some) know that eons from now that boulder will be at the bottom of the slope.\n\nMaybe he should be included with the Hudson River School artists!\n\nWritten by Joan Hawk, Researcher and Co-Owner Bedford Fine Art Gallery, September 10, 2025.
