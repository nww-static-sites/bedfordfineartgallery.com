Visit the Bedford Fine Art Gallery\n\nIf you’re staying at the Omni Bedford Springs Resort, your #1 outing should absolutely be a visit to Bedford Fine Art Gallery. Here’s why it stands out:\n\n* The gallery is located right in historic downtown Bedford (230 S Juliana St., Bedford PA 15522) — only a short drive or ride from your resort.\n* What makes it exceptional: the gallery specializes in original 19th- and early-20th-century works — including American and European paintings, sculptural pieces, animal themes, sporting art, still lifes — no prints or replicas.\n* The setting adds to the experience: the gallery is housed in the historic “Barclay House” (also known as the Bedford Mansion) which gives a sense of depth and character to your visit.\n* As a resort guest, you’re already immersed in the luxury, history and relaxation of Bedford — so stepping into this space of fine art connects beautifully with your surroundings. Whether you are walking the heritage trails, relaxing in the spa, or exploring downtown, this gallery provides a cultured, quiet, meaningful stop.\n* For couples or solo travelers, it’s a refined complement to your resort day; for families, it’s a way to introduce art in a manageable, elegant setting.\n\n**Tips for your visit:**\n\n* Plan to visit during gallery hours: Monday-Saturday 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sunday by appointment.\n* Evening stroll before or after dinner downtown can make the visit feel even more special.\n* Ask about the provenance and background of the artworks — the gallery takes pride in original 19th-century paintings, as well as works from local and regional contemporary artists.\n* If you see a piece you love, you can take home a special souvenir or even consider a purchase — turning your experience into a long-term memory of your stay.\n\nIn short: staying at the Omni Bedford Springs means you’re already in a place steeped in history, natural beauty and restorative experiences — the Bedford Fine Art Gallery is the perfect cultural counterpart to complement your getaway.\n\n- - -\n\n## 2.

According to the resort’s own “Things To Do” guide, “Shopping in Downtown Bedford – 2 miles” is a featured attraction.\n\n**Why this is worthwhile:**\n\n* You’ll find small locally-owned shops that reflect the character of the region.\n* It’s an easy, low-effort outing if you’d rather stay nearby rather than head into deeper countryside.\n* It pairs well with the art gallery visit — you can make a half-day of strolling, grabbing a coffee or light lunch, perhaps checking out an antique store.\n* Great for picking up unique souvenirs or a little something to remind you of your getaway.\n\n**Tip:** Arrive earlier in the day if you prefer a quieter experience and want the best selection in the shops.\n\n- - -\n\n### 3.
