With the explosion of online marketplaces and social media platforms, the internet is flooded with paintings for sale—many of which fall short of the standards that collectors, designers, and discerning art lovers seek. While accessibility has certainly increased, so has the challenge of separating truly fine art from mass-produced or amateur work.\n\n**The Problem with Online Art Shopping**\n\nMost online art platforms prioritize volume over curation. Algorithms highlight popularity rather than quality, and it’s all too common to find poorly executed works, derivative styles, and uninspired compositions crowding the digital landscape.
