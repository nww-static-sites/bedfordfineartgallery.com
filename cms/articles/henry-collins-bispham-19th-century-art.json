In 1860, when Philadelphia’s ear was attuned to the rumblings of war, a nineteen-year-old Bispham, along with other Philadelphia artists -- George F. Bensell, Edward Bensell, John L. Gihon, Ed. McIlhenny, Henry C. Bispham, Robert Wylie, Philip Wharton, William R. McKim and Edgar Wyand founded the Philadelphia Sketch Club.\n\nBispham did not escape the experiences of war – he served with the Twelfth Army Corp under General Banks, where he recorded his observations of men and animals. The war left an imprint on him -- he painted a number of scenes with war-related themes and also authored a book titled “Among the Cattle Drivers of the Army.”\n\nBefore the war, Bispham had trained with Philadelphia artist William Trost Richards for several years and having established himself as an artist, after the war, he left for Europe taking with him many commissions. He made Paris his headquarters from which he made forays into Germany and Italy. Before his departure for Paris, his painting “Sheridan’s Ride” had gained him great acclaim, the *Philadelphia Daily Evening Bulletin* stated that What Mr. Read’s pen has done “For the glorious General’s name, Mr. Bispham’s paint has taken up and presented upon canvas.” In Paris, he studied with Thomas Couture and Otto Weber (var. Webber). He was progressing nicely as an artist and while in Paris sold over twenty of his paintings.\n\nAfter Bispham had returned to the United States, he took up residency in New York City. In 1868, he presented General Ulysses S, Grant his portrait of the famous trotter “Dexter.” The horse’s owner had permitted the future president to ride during him during his presidential campaign. Grant was appreciative of the gift and responded to Bispham: “Please accept my thanks for a present which I prize very highly. I have seen the horse frequently, and think the likeness perfect.”\n\nBispham illustrated the first book of Animals for Children produced in America. In addition to “Dexter,” he also painted a number of other celebrated horses, including “Flora Temple”, “Ethan Allen” and “Patchen.” He also made a life-sized lion painting for the Philadelphia-born actor Edwin Forrest, noted for its ‘faithful and characteristic transcription of nature.’\n\nRome, Italy had, apparently, held great allure for him because circa 1877 he went to Rome and made it his home, specifically, Città Metropolitana di Roma Capitale, Lazio, Italy. Watson’s Art Journal, in 1868, made the statement after his return from Europe “since his return, Mr. Bispham has been a busy man, for he has much to do, and strong subjects enough to occupy a double term of natural life to complete them. Life is too short to work out the golden mine of thought of one great nature.” How unfortunate for the art world that Bispham died at the age of 41 in 1882; his life was too short for one of Philadelphia’s most promising artists. He never had the opportunity to put all those golden thoughts to canvas. He is buried in Rome.\n\nWritten by Joan Hawk, Researcher and Co-Owner Bedford Fine Art Gallery, March 18, 2025.\n\nUse only with the permission of Bedford Fine Art Gallery.\n\nSources:\n\n1. https://newspaperarchive.com/philadelphia-daily-evening-bulletin-jun-02-1866-p-1/\n2. https://newspaperarchive.com/philadelphia-daily-evening-bulletin-jun-16-1866-p-1/\n3. https://newspaperarchive.com/philadelphia-daily-evening-bulletin-dec-29-1868-p-1/\n4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(horse)\n5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(horse)\n6. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/62019712/henry_collins-bispham\n7. https://archive.org/details/jstor-20647831/page/n1/mode/2up?q=henry+c.+bispham (Watson’s Art Journal, Saturday, Feb. 8, 1868, pg. 219).",
