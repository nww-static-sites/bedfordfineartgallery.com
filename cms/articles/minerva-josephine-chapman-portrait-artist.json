  "body": "The period between the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and the 1913 Armory Show in New York found the whole art world bristling with changes. Many of the social strictures that had made a career difficult for women in a male-dominated art world were lifting. However, very real psychological barriers remained. Domestic commitments took much time and energy, thereby inhibiting the full development of many women with artistic talent. Of the many women able to study art, only a few forged successful art careers -- Minerva Josephine Chapman was one of those few successful pioneers in a new era. – Minerva Josephine Chapman Illinois Historical Art Project.\n\nMinerva Josephine Chapman (“Minnie”) was born in Altmar, New York, \\[9]in 1858; however, the family moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1860. As a young woman, she returned east to attend school and graduated from Mount Holyoke College (Massachusetts) in 1878. When Chapman returned to Chicago that same year, she began taking private instruction from Annie Shaw. From 1880 to circa 1886 Chapman studied at the Chicago Academy of Design (now the Art Institute of Chicago) with Chicago artists John Vanderpoel and Alexander Shilling, taking summer classes in plein air painting, organized by the two artists, in the Lebanon valley of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1886 Chapman embarked on a journey to Europe where she first took study with Georgios Jacobides in Munich, Germany, followed by study at the Académie Julian with William Adolphe Bouguereau, Tony Robert-Fleury, and J.P. Laurens. She also studied with Raphael Collins. By far, however, her most influential teacher was American expatriate, Charles Augustus Lasar, at whose atelier, Chapman took additional study (1887 – 97) and with whom she developed a long-lasting friendship. In fact, Lasar painted a portrait of a woman holding a palette who looks remarkably like his student, Minerva Chapman.\n\nShe was to spend a considerable amount of her professional career in Paris, but traveled to Belgium, England and Holland. She painted plein air at Auvers-sur-Oise and Etaples, near Paris, and Lasar’s influence could be seen in her bold plein air painting style. Chapman returned to Chicago circa 1900 and began painting watercolor miniatures on ivory – she was partially responsible for the revival of that age-old art and was a founding member of Chicago Society of Miniature Painters.\n\nChapman made numerous return trips to Paris and in 1903 she took additional study with Emile René Ménard, who encouraged her to paint small oil sketches. In 1906, Chapman was one of the first women to be elected a member of France’s official Salon of the Societe Nationale des Beaux Arts and would become the first woman president of the International Art Union (Paris, 1909 -12). When she returned to the United States in 1925, she moved to palo Alto, California and continued to paint until 1932 when failing eyesight brought an end to professional art career. Best known for her portrait, still life and landscape painting, her miniatures gained her recognition during the last 20 years of her professional career.\n\nChapman was a member of the Chicago Society of Miniature Painters; American Women’s; Art Association, Paris; Art Union, Paris (president 1909 – 12).She exhibited at the Chicago Society of Artists (1893); World’s Columbia Exposition (1893, Illinois Building and Women’s Building); Cosmopolitan Club (Chicago, 1893); Societe Nationale de Beaux-Arts (Paris, 1897, 1899); Art\n\nInstitute of Chicago (1897 – 1910, 1908 solo); 1915, 1919, 1927); Central Art Association (Chicago, 1898); Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (Philadelphia, 1899); Paris Salon (1899 – 1926); Pan-American Exp.
